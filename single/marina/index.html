    <span slot="text"> The conversation surrounding the memories at El Valle de los Caídos (Valley of the Fallen) requires the creation of a new symbolic, cultural, political, and legal framework that defines the architecture over time. To make this happen, the tourism at the monument should be dismantled in order to mark the site as a mass cemetery. Visitors to the monument should soley pay tribute to those who have died in the Spanish Civil War. Furthermore, there should be a site on El Valle de los Caídos for identifying and naming those who have remained unnamed at the monument.<br><br> </span>
    <span slot="text"> El Valle de los Caídos is a controversial case study, and the Spanish country continues to struggle to come to terms with the memories at the site. Commissioned in 1940 by general and dictator Francisco Franco (the Head of State and Government of Spain), the memorial and monument was constructed to pay tribute to the “heroes and martyrs” of the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939).[1] Franco’s fascist troops eventually won the war, and the dictatorship ended after Franco’s death from heart failure in 1975. The monument arose at the time Franco abolished the Second Spanish Republic’s constitution in 1939, initiating freedom of speech, introducing women’s right to vote, granting divorce, and establishing secular education for Spanish citizens. The dictatorship imposed Falangist, Catholic, and nationalist motivations that work its way in the design of El Valle de los Caídos. In 1940, Franco announced, “The dimension of our Crusade, the heroic sacrifices involved in the victory and the far-reaching significance that this epic has had for the future of Spain cannot be perpetuated with the simple monuments with which the outstanding events of our history and the glorious deeds of her sons are often commemorated in towns and villages. The stones that are to be erected must have the grandeur of the monuments of old, which defy time and oblivion.”[9] </span>

In 1977, Spain celebrated its first free general election, and an agreement known as Pacto del Olvido (Pact of Forgetting) passed, granting forgiveness for the crimes during the Spanish dictatorship with hopes of moving forward and forgetting the past.[3] Headed by the government of the Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party and Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, the pact ended when Congress approved The Historical Memory Law in October 2007.[1] The Historical Memory Law acknowledges and provides aid to the victims of the Spanish Civil War and dictatorship, as well as to their family; rallies support for the tracking, recognition, and exhumation of missing persons; and condemns the Francoist dictatorship.[2] The law also condemns the commemoration of political events at El Valle de los Caídos, most notably by the far right groups celebrating the dictator on November 20, the day of his passing.[2] These events have ended since October 2019 due to the exhumation of Franco’s body from the monument.[3] In September 2020, the Spanish Cabinet passed the Democratic Memory Law. Expanding from the Historical Memory Law, the Democratic Meory Law urges to shut down organizations that honor Franco’s memory, such as the National Francisco Franco Foundation—a foundation set up by sympathizers in 1976 to glorify the dictator. The law also issues provisions for an office for democratic memory and human rights and for a DNA bank for the exhumation of the bodies at El Valle de los Caídos.[8]</span>

    The Silence of Others is released and gains worldwide acclaim. The film reveals the epic struggle of victims of Spain’s 40-year dictatorship under General Franco, as they organize an international lawsuit and fight the Pact of Forgetting. The film offers a tale about fascism and the dangers of forgetting the past, and speaks powerfully to issues of transitional justice and universal jurisdiction.

        <div id="1-variable-text-slot">
        <span slot="text">El Valle de los Caídos is at the forefront of an ethical dispute. To remove the symbols of Franco’s dictatorship from Madrid, such as street names, plaques, and monuments, the municipality, organized by the Mayor Manuela Carmena, created the “Historical Memory Commission.” In May 2016, after the decisions made in October 2008 by Judge Baltasar Garzón, who instructed the exhumation of nineteen graves, Judge Jose Manuel Delgado approved the exhumation of Antonio Ramiro and Manuel Lapeña from El Valle de los Caídos.[1] </span>
        <span slot="pull-quote">In 1959, their bodies were exhumed, without consent from their family, and reburied at El Valle de los Caídos.</span>
        <span slot="text"><br>The Lapeña family members were executed by the dictator’s troops in 1936 and buried at the cemetery in Calatayud—a town southwest of Zaragoza. In 1959, their bodies were exhumed, without consent from their family, and reburied at El Valle de los Caídos.[3] There have since been disagreements between Patrimonio Nacional (the National Heritage Agency owning the monument) and the community of Benedictine monks who live in the Santa Cruz abbey in the monument. This dispute has since postponed the implementation of the ruling. Specifically, the Benedictine monks denied permission to the workers who had been sent to execute the court orders. The monks declare that the procedure would affect the stability of the structure. The tension between these opposing forces continues to persist.</span>

        <div id="2-variable-text-slot">
        <span slot="text">El Valle de los Caídos also has been a tourist attraction in Madrid. Tourists photograph the monument without knowing that it is a symbol of the victory of fascism. Patrimonio Nacional urges silence inside the basilica, and rejects the implementation of brochures, plaques, or an information center.[1] The construction and maintenance of the monument, which continue to create tensions in Spanish society, bring to light the culture supported by the dictator. </span>

  <span slot="h3">constructing a 
    historical memory</span>
  <span slot="text">Conversations over the preservation and maintenance of El Valle de los Caídos bring up distress and indifference. The monument, constructed between 1940 and 1959, is the notable work of Franquista architecture. The nature of the monument continues to haunt Spanish life, so there is a strong need for a construction of historical memory. </span>
  <span slot="pull-quote">El Valle de los Caídos serves a fascist ideology, and continues its legacy of repression.</span>
  <span slot="text">The remains of the victims would be a part of a monument that commemorates and continues their silence. Roughly twelve thousand bodies remain nameless. [3] Here, El Valle de los Caídos serves a fascist ideology, and continues its legacy of repression. However, families of the relatives resting at the monument now hope that Franco’s exhumation will help their own quest to identify and rebury their loved ones. Fausto Canales, the son of Mr. Canales, who was shot by Fascist sympathizers of Franco in August 1936 and buried at the monument without prior knowledge or consent of his family, stated, “If we really want to overcome the wounds of our civil war and build a more educated [...] democratic society, we have a huge workload left before us, which certainly includes giving every victim a proper burial.”[10] There is a demand for creativity, responsibility and sensitivity for the future of the monument.[2] Conversations arise to come up with future plans of the monument, challenge the decades of silence, and create a design for shared memories.</span>
