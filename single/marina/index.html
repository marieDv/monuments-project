    <span slot="text"> The conversation surrounding the memories at El Valle de los Caídos (Valley of the Fallen) requires the creation of a new symbolic, cultural, political, and legal framework that defines the architecture over time. To make this happen, the tourism at the monument should be dismantled in order to mark the site as a mass cemetery. Visitors to the monument should soley pay tribute to those who have died in the Spanish Civil War. Furthermore, there should be a site on El Valle de los Caídos for identifying and naming those who have remained unnamed at the monument.<br><br> </span>
    <span slot="text"> El Valle de los Caídos is a controversial case study, and the Spanish country continues to struggle to come to terms with the memories at the site. Ordered in 1940 by general and dictator Francisco Franco (the Head of State and Government of Spain), the memorial and monument was constructed to pay tribute to those that passed away during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939).<sup>1</sup> Franco’s fascist troops eventually won the war, and the dictatorship ended after Franco’s death from heart failure in 1975. The monument arose at the time Franco abolished the Second Spanish Republic’s constitution in 1939, initiating freedom of speech, introducing women’s right to vote, granting divorce, and establishing secular education for Spanish citizens.<sup>1</sup> The dictatorship forced Catholic, Falangist, and nationalist motivations that work its way in the design of El Valle de los Caídos. In 1940, Franco announced, “The dimension of our Crusade, the heroic sacrifices involved in the victory and the far-reaching significance that this epic has had for the future of Spain cannot be perpetuated with the simple monuments with which the outstanding events of our history and the glorious deeds of her sons are often commemorated in towns and villages. The stones that are to be erected must have the grandeur of the monuments of old, which defy time and oblivion.”<sup>1</sup> </span>

    <span slot="block-quote">My family spent years living with the rumor that my father had been shot, but with no idea where and with my mother simply crying whenever his name was mentioned. We knew Vitorino because his name got engraved on the facade of our village church, on a plaque for those who had fallen for God and Spain. So we knew he had died for Franco, but people were just too afraid to ask exactly how.<sup>10</sup></span>

<span slot="h3">PHYSICAL PROPERTIES</span> 
<span slot="text">The location selected for the study is at the Nava cliff in the Sierra Guadarrama, northwest of Madrid, Spain. Its architecture, put together by a workforce that was made up of roughly 40,000 convicts and political prisoners, house 33,847 bodies exhumed from mass graves, mainly without the permission of the deceased’s families.<sup>2</sup>  There are bodies from both the Nationalist and Republican sides, whose bones were dug up from cemeteries across Spain and reburied in the monument in a feigned attempt at reconciliation. Although 21,000 sets of remains were taken there with the knowledge and permission of the families – and those from the Nationalist side were labelled with names and surnames – the remainder arrived in boxes stating only how many bodies they contained and which town they had come from.<sup>13</sup>

  As if that weren’t enough, water has seeped into the floors and walls of the mausoleum’s crypts for decades, destroying many of the boxes and mingling bones. “There are thousands of boxes in each chapel, and they’re stacked from floor to ceiling, like shoeboxes,” says Francisco Etxeberria, a leading forensic anthropologist who examined the remains of Cervantes.<sup>13</sup> “You have to drill into the walls – which are brick, concrete and cement – to open up a hole. All you can see are the boxes. Nothing else.”<sup>13</sup>

<span slot="text">Numerous perished fighting for Franco, but others fought against the dictator, including Republican prisoners of the Spanish war who died while working on the construction of El Valle de los Caídos. A 150-meter tall cross sits atop a Benedictine basilica under which the dictator rested from 1975 to 2019.<sup>1</sup> This cross has long acted as a symbol for those who rue the end of Francoism and its creed of National Catholicism. It is precisely because of that, says Martínez, that the site must be turned into a place of solemn remembrance where visitors can come to learn about everything the mausoleum was intended to celebrate and symbolise.</span>

  <span id="2-headline" slot="h3">LEGAL FRAMEWORKS</span>
  <div id="variable-text-slot">
  <span slot="text">Even after Franco’s death, there were reminders of the dictatorship throughout the Spanish country. Spain started its first general election in 1977, and an agreement known as Pacto del Olvido (Pact of Forgetting) passed, granting forgiveness for the crimes during the Spanish dictatorship with hopes of moving forward and forgetting the past.<sup>3</sup> Headed by the government of the Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party and Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, the pact ended when Congress approved The Historical Memory Law in October 2007.<sup>1</sup> The Historical Memory Law acknowledges and provides aid to the victims of the Spanish Civil War and dictatorship, as well as to their family; rallies support for the tracking, recognition, and exhumation of missing persons; and condemns the Francoist dictatorship.<sup>1</sup> The law also condemns the commemoration of political events at El Valle de los Caídos, most notably by the far right groups celebrating the dictator on November 20, the day of his passing.<sup>2</sup> These events have ended since October 2019 due to the exhumation of Franco’s body from the monument.<sup>3</sup> From September 2020, the Spanish Cabinet is set to pass the Democratic Memory Bill. Expanding from the Historical Memory Law, the Democratic Memory Bill urges to shut down organizations that honor Franco’s memory, such as the National Francisco Franco Foundation—a foundation set up by sympathizers in 1976 to glorify the dictator. The bill also issues provisions for an office for democratic memory, a ban on groups that glorify the Franco regime, a “redefinition” of El Valle de los Caídos, and a DNA bank for the exhumation of the bodies at El Valle de los Caídos. The government says the proposed law will help “encourage a shared discussion based on the defence of peace, on pluralism and on broadening human rights and constitutional freedoms”. Some, however, are in no mood to talk. Or listen.<sup>8</sup></span>
  <span slot="pull-quote">In 1977, Spain celebrated its first free general election, and an agreement known as Pacto del Olvido (Pact of Forgetting) passed, granting legal forgiveness for the crimes during the Spanish dictatorship with hopes of moving forward and forgetting the past.</span>
  <span slot="text"><br/>Spain’s conservative People’s Party (PP) – the descendant of a political alliance founded by former Francoist ministers – has long opposed efforts to probe the past, arguing that the pact of forgetting that enabled Spain’s return to democracy ought to be untouched and respected. The PP’s Mariano Rajoy, who was prime minister from 2011 to 2018, focused on cutting Spain’s historical memory budget to zero after his administration inherited the 2007 law. This month, Pablo Casado, who succeeded Rajoy as PP leader, stood in a bullring in Valencia and promised to repeal the new legislation, saying it served only to “dig up grudges”. Fernando Martínez, a historian who was brought in as secretary of state for democratic memory last year, has little time for such complaints. Now a team of forensic experts prepare to enter El Valle de los Caídos to begin searching for the bodies of 77 of the thousands of people whose remains were reburied there alongside Franco without their families’ consent, Martínez says the proposed new law is both timely and overdue. “There’s a fundamental point here, which is that these sorts of things say a lot about a democracy,” he says. “And, obviously, this country has to live up to the same standards as its neighbours in western Europe who have already resolved these questions. All this – recovering the bodies and redefining the valley – strengthens democracy. You could say it’s all a bit late, but it has to be done.”<sup>8</sup></span>

<div id="1-variable-text-slot"> 
<span slot="text">El Valle de los Caídos is at the forefront of an ethical dispute. To remove the symbols of Franco’s dictatorship from Madrid, such as street names, plaques, and monuments, the municipality, organized by the Mayor Manuela Carmena, created the “Historical Memory Commission.”<sup>1</sup> In May 2016, after the decisions made in October 2008 by Judge Baltasar Garzón, who instructed the exhumation of nineteen graves, Judge Jose Manuel Delgado approved the exhumation of Antonio Ramiro and Manuel Lapeña from El Valle de los Caídos.<sup>1</sup> </span>

<span slot="text"><br>The Lapeña family members were executed by the dictator’s troops in 1936 and buried at the cemetery in Calatayud—a town southwest of Zaragoza. In 1959, their bodies were exhumed, without consent from their family, and reburied at El Valle de los Caídos.<sup>12</sup> There have since been disagreements between Patrimonio Nacional (the National Heritage Agency owning the monument) and the community of Benedictine monks who live in the Santa Cruz abbey in the monument.</span>

  <span slot="text">Conversations over the preservation and maintenance of El Valle de los Caídos bring up further issues. The monument, constructed between 1940 and 1959, is the notable work of Franquista architecture. The nature of the monument continues to haunt Spanish life, so there is a strong need for a construction of historical memory. </span>
  <span slot="pull-quote">El Valle de los Caídos serves a fascist ideology, and continues its legacy of repression.</span>
  <span slot="text">The remains of the victims would be a part of a monument that commemorates and continues their silence. Roughly twelve thousand bodies remain nameless.<sup>11</sup> Here, El Valle de los Caídos serves a fascist ideology, and continues its legacy of repression. However, families of the relatives resting at the monument now hope that Franco’s exhumation will help their own quest to identify and rebury their loved ones. Fausto Canales’ grandfather was shot by Fascist sympathizers of Franco in August 1936 and buried at the monument without prior knowledge or consent of his family, and he explained, “If we really want to overcome the wounds of our civil war and build a more educated [...] democratic society, we have a huge workload left before us, which certainly includes giving every victim a proper burial.”<sup>10</sup> There is a demand for recontextualizing the monument that is sensitive and respectful for the future generations.<sup>2</sup> Conversations continue to come up with future plans of the monument, work against the silence, and create a design for the memories.</span>
