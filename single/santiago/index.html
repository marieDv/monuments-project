    <span slot="text"> On september last year the statue of sebastian de Belalcazar was toppled down from its pedestal
      in the city of Popayan, Colombia, from where it had stood for more than 5 decades. Many condemned the action
      claiming that it was eraising history, but the truth is that the statue of Belalcazar was never supposed to be
      there in the first place. That pedestal belonged to the cacique Puben, a prominent indigenous leader from the
      times of colonization, but sadly the original plan was tossed aside and the cacique was lost.

      This chain of events and the now empty pedestal represent not only a discontent of a specific community, but the
      historical tendency that exists in Colombia to exalt whiteness and disregard the indigenous community.

            <div id="variable-text-slot">
            <span slot="text">The past 16 of September of 2020 in the city of papaya in Colombia, the equestrian statue of the Spanish conquistador Sebastian de Belalcazar was toppled down by a group of indigenous people of the Misak tribe. The statue had been there since 1937 when it was commissioned to the Spanish artist Victorio Macho for the celebration of 400 years of the city. It was there because the foundation of the city is attributed to Belalcazar, but the truth is that he only defeated and sub sequentially conquered an indigenous group of around 3.000 people who historically had been the rulers of the land. Descendants of said people were the ones who toppled down the statue , and rightfully so,
              Not only was it an insult to the land and their original inhabitants, but to add salt to injury, the statue was situated at the top of the Morro del Tulcan, a sacred hill for the pre-columbian community.<br><br>
              
              While the action was heavily criticised and was deemed as  “historical erasure” and “destruction of patrimony” by some, It seems that those in charge got the message. The mayor of the town promised to not put the statue back up and so the pedestal remains empty for now.<br><br>
              
              This story has become very familiar nowadays, people fed up with the exaltation of
              a problematic historical figure decide to take matters into their own hands and bring it down. People from every side of the political spectrum frown upon it and those on the ground celebrate its fall. After a few weeks the discussion fades only to be reignited when the statue inevitably goes up again.<br><br>
              
              What makes this story different though is that back in 1937 when the city celebrated its anniversary another statue was commissioned. A statue for the Cacique Puben.
              The Cacique Puben was renowned indigenous leader who once fought against the Spanish and defended the land.  For the celebration of 400 years of Popayan a statue was made by Romulo Rozo and it was to be put up along side belalcazar. Belalcazar was intended to be on the city’s main square and Puben up in the Morro del Tulcan, therefore celebrating the city’s heritage from both sides. In the end the city opted to place Belalcazar on its own and the cacique was lost.<br><br>
              
              The city chose to side itself with is spanish heritage exclusively, leaving aside the indigenous identity which precede it, Quite literally taking its rightful place in the Morro del Tulcan.<br><br>
              
              Since the event may more conquistador statues have been toppled worldwide, and even the Misak people brought down another one in Bogota, the country’s capital. A few kilometers away in Cali, Belalcazar was also toppled again despite the governments best efforts to protect it. Perhaps we could label these events as the result of jaded individuals, incapable of leaving the past behind, or maybe they are just indicative of frustration with the current government. But to take it as an isolated event, in historical and social vacuum would do a disservice to the act and would be condescending to the people who did it.<br><br>
              So now that the statue has been toppled down it begs the questions then,

                    To answer the questions the statues of belalcazar and the cacique puben present it is necessary to start from the beginning of the colonization .<br><br>

                    In 1499 Alonso de Ojeda disembarked on the arid beaches of La Guajira, up in the north of Colombia. The colonization began immediately.
                    fortunately for the Spanish , and unfortunately for everyone else, the indigenous groups in the Colombian territory were scattered with virtually no network between one another.
                    this facilitated the conquest, as the small indigenous groups across Colombia stood no chance. <br><br>
                    
                    what followed was an uncontested rule by the spanish, who destroyed almost all that was before their arrival and subjugated the native population. <br><br>
                    
                    The nature of the pre-columbian communities in the territory though represent two major issues that are now reflected on Colombia identity. <br><br>
                    
                    firstly, the small pre-colombian communities had no need for big monuments or anything of the sort, meaning that now, unlike Peru or Mexico and other latinamerican countries, there is virtually no 
                    physical reminder of what it was before, making for a connection with our roots more difficult. <br><br>
                    
                    and secondly, the small percentage of native Colombians were not sufficient for labour force, meaning that mixing was a necessity to populate the land. <br><br>
                    
                    make no mistake though, the mixing orchestrated by the Spanish was also a deliberate method to get rid of the identity of native population too.<br>
                    not only did it get rid of the vast majority of future generations of native Colombians to come , it also created a system of social casts with the intention of pitting those who were not Spanish against each other. <br><br>
                    
                    by mixing the Spanish with the native population, the mestizo was born. The mestizo was thus considered better that their indigenous ancestors but lower in the social pyramid than the pure breed Spanish.<br>
                    The mestizos then were rewarded if they chose to side themselves with their white parents. to get ahead in life it was necessary to become as white as you could, but culturally and genetically for future generations.<br>
                    The destruction of the indigenous identity was assured. since then, Colombian mestizos aim towards whiteness. by all means is a wound that has yet to heal.<br><br>
                    
                    In a way the complex social pyramid created by the Spanish all those years ago is still alive and well, <br>
                    whiteness is still celebrates,<br>
                    mestizos aspire to be white,<br>
                    the native communities are neglected and ignores,<br>
                    and the black communities are pretty much segregated. <br><br>
                    
                    the identity of colomabins is still decided by the hundred years of colonization.<br>
                    whiteness still sits atop the pyramid, in a nice pedestal. <br><br>
