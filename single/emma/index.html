    <span slot="text"> An Icelandic explorer (born around the year 1000) statue that has two castings of the same monument with different stories of fate surrounding them.<br><br>
One was placed in Philadelphia, US and the other in Reykjavík, Iceland. Linking together different geographical points, the statues have through the years hae aquired different stories and visibility to the public.<br><br>
The statue in Philadelphia was toppled into the Scuylkill River 2018, following years of it serving as a meeting point of opposite political groups of extreme right wing party and Antifa protesting white supremacists groups accumulating. At the same time the statue placed in Iceland, has had none of political display surrounding it, other than being moved 3 times, each time to less centric place than before.</span>

  <span slot="text">From the statue of Ingólfur Arnarson, one of Iceland’s first settlers, to the monument to 19th century Icelandic independence figure Jón Sigurðsson, Einar Jónsson’s public sculptures have profoundly shaped the visual character of Iceland.

Born in 1847 and educated in Denmark and Rome, Einar Jónsson sailed to the United States in 1917, and was commissioned by the Fairmount Park Art Association to create a sculpture of Þorfinnur Karlsefni, a Norse explorer who, as recounted in Grænlendinga saga and Eirík’s saga rauða, journeyed to Vínland, the fabled Norse settlement in North America. </span>

It’s been a long time planning to move the statue of Þorfinn. Firstly it should be mentioned that the sculptor himself, Einar Jónsson, was not satisfied with it’s original placement, even though he was involved with the decicion. He had though expressed his will before his death, of it getting a new home.

The removal and moving of the statue was no small task. When developments and plans of expanding the area of the pond in favour of the birdlife thriving there, it seemed like a good oppurtunity to relocate the statue at the same time. Now it has reached dry land and is in storage by the skrúðgarða of the city.
This operation is done with approval and motivation of the Public art committee.

Three main locations are up for discussion as the new location of the statue. Firstly west of Öskjuhlíð below the hot water supply tanks. Another idea is north of the Fishermen’s school, on the rockformations west of Tónabíó cinema – and that is the most likely placement. Also there have been mentions of Laugarás  </span>
