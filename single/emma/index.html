    <span slot="text"> An Icelandic explorer (born around the year 1000) statue that has two castings of the same monument with different stories of fate surrounding them.<br><br>
One was placed in Philadelphia, US and the other in Reykjavík, Iceland. Linking together different geographical points, the statues have through the years aquired very different stories of visibility and ideology.<br><br>
The statue in Philadelphia was toppled discreetly at night into the Scuylkill River 2018, following years of it serving as a meeting point of opposites and protests. Becoming a point of interest to extreme right wing groups and Antifa protesting the white supremacists group accumulating. At the same time the statue placed in the less populated place, Iceland, has had none of political display surrounding it. In fact it has become close to invisible, after being moved at least three times, each time to less centric place than before. Slowly becoming mundane part if its own surroundings next to a small cinema. </span>

  <span slot="text">‘"The statue as a memorial of the event when Þorfinnur Karlsefni was the first leader of white inhabitants of this area of this area of land" – and this being group of icelanders.
<br><br>
Þorfinnur Karlsefni is said to have been born around 972. In the year around 1007 he sailed with his spouse to “Vinland the good” and settled there supposedly for 2–3 years in peace. Then he went on to Greenland and later three years later on back again to Iceland. Þorfinnur Karlsefni was not known as a exceptional warrior and no sources have been found of him encountering in battles or encountering indiginous people.
<br><br>
Nevertheless the story puts him to be in the forefront of white settlement of this era of land, "and so should his name be remembered and elevated."" </span>

<span slot="block-quote">
Like the article, from more than hundreds years ago, quotes the history of this viking persona has not become clearer to large extent since. Other than supposedly journeying to the nort America right behind Leifur Eiríksson.

  <span slot="text">From the statue of Ingólfur Arnarson, one of Iceland’s first settlers, to the monument to 19th century Icelandic independence figure Jón Sigurðsson, Einar Jónsson’s public sculptures have profoundly shaped the visual character of Iceland.

Born in 1847 and educated in Denmark and Rome, Einar Jónsson sailed to the United States in 1917, and was commissioned by the Fairmount Park Art Association to create a sculpture of Þorfinnur Karlsefni, a Norse explorer who, as recounted in Grænlendinga saga and Eirík’s saga rauða, journeyed to Vínland, the fabled Norse settlement in North America. <br> <br> Einar Jónsson Museum.

  <span slot="block-quote">These images show the base being broken and the statue taking flight on its location on a small bay south of the Reykjavík Pond.

It’s been a long time planning to move the statue of Þorfinn. Firstly it should be mentioned that the sculptor himself, Einar Jónsson, was not satisfied with it’s original placement, even though he was involved with the decicion. He had though expressed his will before his death, of it getting a new home.

The removal and moving of the statue was no small task. When developments and plans of expanding the area of the pond in favour of the birdlife thriving there, it seemed like a good oppurtunity to relocate the statue at the same time. Now it has reached dry land and is in storage by the skrúðgarða of the city.
This operation is done with approval and motivation of the Public art committee.

Three main locations are up for discussion as the new location of the statue. Firstly west of Öskjuhlíð below the hot water supply tanks. Another idea is north of the Fishermen’s school, on the rockformations west of Tónabíó cinema – and that is the most likely placement. Also there have been mentions of Laugarás  </span>

To reevaluate and open a dialouge of its role or history in enviroments could open up a redesign of its context. Reframing through added information to tell better of its original context to contrast to how it could be and has been used as a object of protest.
