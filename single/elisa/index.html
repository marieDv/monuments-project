    <span slot="text">The American Museum of Natural History has promised to remove the Equestrian Statue of Theodore
      Roosevelt because of its white supremacist composition. However, problematic features of the statue can be found
      throughout the museum’s own exhibitions. This project brings the problematic practices in the depths of the museum
      out in front of the monument. It turns to anthropological tone and diorama-format, used extensively in the museum,
      as further critique of its practices.</span>

        <h3>Walking up to the monument</h3>
        First there is the figure of Theodore Roosevelt, New York asthmatic rich kid, turned North
        Dakota cowboy, who grew up to become one of the most revered American presidents. He is a complicated
        turn-of-the-century figure—conservationist, adventurer, military hawk, known both for inspiring the name Teddy
        Bear and the numerous axioms, most famously for his praise of the `man who is actually in the arena, whose face
        is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again…”
        <br>
        <br>
        In this monument, erected 22 years after his death, Roosevelt, sits astride the horse, sleeves rolled up to show
        giant forearms, reins in hand, his other hand resting on a pistol looking the manly hero. If this were the
        extent of the statue, it would probably be left alone. Another white man of historical prominence and
        long-debated legacy elevated and enlarged.
        <br>
        <br>
        However, Theodore Roosevelt is not alone. Standing alongside his horse are two figures whose heads reach his
        waist. On the left is a figure understood to be Native American with a feathered headdress, braids, and a
        necklace. On the right is a half-naked man, with braids and a shield on his back—the African. Both figures are
        draped in almost toga-like clothing and they stare straight ahead with blank expressions. These figures do not
        represent individuals, they are allegorical—standing for their respective lands. So in a word, Roosevelt is not
        just leading two figures in this arrangement, he is bridging two lands: North America and Africa. They are
        accessories to the Roosevelt narrative of exploration, expansion, and strength.
        <br>
        <br>
        While it would be hard to see all this detail from the angle of the visitor—whose head barely reaches the top of
        the pedestal—after spending a few minutes contemplating the close-up images, printed at the base of the statue,
        the values are clear and repulsive. This is a depiction we would not make today and there are unusual points of
        care and neglect at the artistic level. Care in the rendering, neglect in the narrative.
        <br>
        <br>
        While this statue will be removed, as requested by the museum and long demanded by local activist groups, it
        cannot be solitary act. The hierarchy and attributes that render the monument unacceptable are found throughout
        the present and past of the museum. If the removal is a solitary act, the same values, obscured by technical
        language and scientific rendering, will continue to impact the museum’s visitors, without clear opening for
        critique.

        <h3>Flipping the Diorama</h3>
        It can be challenging to see the inherent bias in the AMNH museum exhibitions. They awe us with their craft and
        contents; however, they neglect to articulate time periods or question their own observations. However, littered
        throughout the musuem are plaques thanking and honoring the trustees. What if we were to place them in the glass
        boxes? How could we understand their "otherness"?
