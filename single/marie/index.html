    <span slot="text"> The figure of Dr. Karl Lueger is under constant critical discussion. Now a recent artistic
      intervention on the monument has sparked new controversy around his memorial in the center of Vienna. Following
      the Black Lives Matter protests in the city activists sprayed the word “Schande”, in English “shame” over the
      memorial, starting a new call for its removal. Lueger used anti-Semitic hate speech as a tool for his political
      career. He laid the foundation that allowed Adolf Hitler’s raise to power. Yet there are still many structures in
      the city of Vienna that are named after him in memory of his legacy as a major. The most prominent probably being
      his memorial statue in the heart of the city.
      <br><br>
      This case study investigates the roots of Luegers popularity and rises questions about the justification of his
      ongoing presence in the landscape of Vienna.

        Lueger was one of the first politicans in Austria that build a personal cult around himself.
        Often referred to as the “beautiful Karl”, or “God of Vienna” he receveied praise in many songs, poems and a
        play called “Lueger, der große Österreicher”(Lueger, the magnificent Austrian) by Hans Naderer that was
        performed as an expression of the Austrofascist regime. Lueger understood himself as a politican for the common
        man. And he knew how to communicate efficently towards this group by using strong retoric, sarcasm and
        demagogy.
        <!-- <br><br>After Luegers death in 1910 the Christian social party continued to use depictions of him in
        advertisments. The political personality Lueger and his popularity instrumentalize a positive Self-portrait of
        the party. The Christian social voters should equate his character, integrity and features such as competence,
        discipline, success and state leadership qualities with the values of the party. -->

    <div id="variable-text-slot">
      <span slot="text">During Dr. Karl Luegers tenure, Vienna gained the negative reputation of the first
        anti-Semitically governed metropolis in Europe. Lueger realized the effectiveness of a demagogically and
        rhetorically employed "hostility to Jews" and used it for his rise to power in Vienna. <br><br>He was the
        founder and leader of the Christian Social party in the 1880s and they quickly rivaled the Social Democrats
        (Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreichs, SPÖ) that had some famous Jewish members such as Otto Bauer.
        Anti-Semitism united the Christian Social Party and contributed to bringing Lueger into the position of major of
        Vienna which he should inherit from 1897 to 1910. <br><br>Luegers anti-Semitic political views are often
        described as purely opportunistic. He took advantage of the economically grounded anti-Jewish mood in which
        Jewish industrialists and bankers were considered to be the cause of social problems. Hitler admired Lueger for
        his speech-making skills and effective use of propaganda in gaining popular appeal. He studied Lueger carefully
        and modeled some of his later behavior on what he learned.</span>

        It is hard to tell how much of the admiration towards Lueger is based on his achievements as a major and what’s
        the remains of an intense personal cult and the appropriation of his character to achieve political goals during
        his lifetime and after. <br> <br> The Lueger memorial is currently contextualized through a table that was added
        by Vienna’s City Councilor for Culture in 2016. I don’t think that this contextualization is enough, considering
        that the memorial is still used as a gathering point for right-wing fascists. <br> Multiple other
        reminiscent of Luegers time as a major have already been removed or renamed. I hope that the recent protests and
        discussions serve as a katalysator for a more proper contextualization, or eventually the removal, of the memorial.<br><br>
