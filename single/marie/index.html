    <span slot="text"> While the figure of Dr Karl Lueger has already been critically discussed in the past few years a
      recent artistic intervention on the monument has sparked new controversy around his memorial in the center of
      Vienna. Luegers raise to power was largely due to his use of anti-Semitic propaganda. His rhetoric and
      anti-Semitic views have inspired the young Adolf Hitler and shaped his later raise to power. This case study
      serves as a personal deep dive into the figure of the layed major. I hope this research provides context to the
      current political discussion and serves as a quick summary for those who want to understand the debate around the
      memorial better. </span>

        Lueger was one of the first politicans in Austria that build a personal cult around himself.
        Often referred to as the “beautiful Karl”, or “God of Vienna” he receveied praise in many songs, poems and a
        play called “Lueger, der große Österreicher”(Lueger, the magnificent Austrian) by Hans Naderer that was
        performed as an expression of the Austrofascist regime. Lueger understood himself as a politican for the common
        man. And he knew how to communicate efficently towards this group by using strong retoric, sarcasm and
        demagogy.<br><br>After Luegers death in 1910 the Christian social party continued to use depictions of him in
        advertisments. The political personality Lueger and his popularity instrumentalize a positive Self-portrait of
        the party. The Christian social voters should equate his character, integrity and features such as competence,
        discipline, success and state leadership qualities with the values of the party.

      <span slot="text"> Dr. Karl Lueger died on March 10, 1910. Just one day later, the first donations for the
        erection of a Lueger memorial were received by the Reichspost.
        Two weeks after his death, the Christian Social Party applied to the city council for the erection of a Lueger
        monument on the square in front of the New Town Hall.
        Contemporaries criticized that the memorial was not only supposed to be a place for rememberance but also a
        display of power of the political party whose representative Lueger had been considered: “…. The significance of
        passed events should be demonstrated to the whole world, but especially to the parties opponents ... " One
        criticized - to put it casually - the megalomania of the monument: the huge sum of money that was made available
        & the space where it was supposed to be set up (Rathausplatz)
        The erection of the memorial was approved, but the question of the location should still lead to heated
        discussions - ultimately the memorial should be erected at the Dr. Karl-Lueger-Platz, that is located on the
        Stubenring.</span>

      <span slot="text">During Dr.Karl Luegers tenure, Vienna gained the negative reputation of the first
        anti-Semitically governed metropolis in Europe. Lueger realized the effectiveness of a demagogically and
        rhetorically employed "hostility to Jews" and used it for his rise to power in Vienna. Lueger founded and lead
        the Christian Social party in the 1880s, which quickly rivaled the Social Democrats (Sozialdemokratische Partei
        Österreichs, SPÖ) that had some famous jewish members such as Otto Bauer. Anti-Semitism united the Christian
        Social Party and contributed to bringing Lueger into the position of major of Vienna which he should inherit
        from 1897 to 1910.
        Luegers anti-Semitic political views are often described as purely opportunistic. He took advantage of the
        economically grounded anti-Jewish mood in which Jewish industrialists and bankers were considered to be the
        cause of social problems. Hitler admired Lueger for his speech-making skills and effective use of propaganda in
        gaining popular appeal. He studied Lueger carefully and modeled some of his later behavior on what he learned.
        <br><br> After his death in 1910 the Christian Social Party continued to create illustrations and posters of him
        that depicted his fight against the Jewish “Mammon” and Liberalism.</span>
      <span slot="pull-quote">some politically motivated groups still symbolize and idealize Lueger and use his memorial
        as a gathering point for speeches and demonstrations that often follow an anti-immigrant and xenophobic
        agenda.</span>

      <span slot="text">
        It is hard to tell how much of the admiration towards Lueger is based on his achievements as a major and what’s the remains of an intense personal cult and the instrumentalization of his character to achieve political goals during his lifetime and after. It can be said with certainty that his contemporary popularity has little to do with his actual achievements and more so with the use of his figure from various political groups that kept his memory alive. A statue that is used as gathering point for right-wing fascists that keeps this legacy of anti-Semitic and Xenophobia alive cannot stay untouched. 
        Multiple remainescenants of Luegers time as a major have already been removed. 
                           The Green party already pushed for the renaming of the “Dr Karl Lueger Ring”, one of the most central roads in Vienna in 2012. There were also plans to contextualize the memorial of Dr Karl Lueger further, that were not approved by their coalition partner the Social Democratic Party of Austria.
        <br><br>
        
        2016 Vienna's City Councilor for Culture Andreas Mailath-Pokorny and District Chairman Markus Figl unveiled a table for the Lueger monument on Dr.-Karl-Lueger-Platz. The text is written by historian Oliver Rathkolb in collaboration with the Vienna 1 Cultural Commission.
        <br><br>
        “The table reminds of both sides of Karl Lueger, of the energetic mayor who drove the city's development into a modern metropolis, as well as of the politician who made use of political anti-Semitism and reinforced nationalistic tendencies of his time. The monument can only be understood from its time and is placed in a historical context through the information on the board. The Wienkl complements the Lueger monument in a clear, informative way. This will continue the efforts of the City of Vienna to address history and raise awareness, ”says Vienna's City Councilor for Culture Andreas
        <br><br>
        Following the Black Lives Matter movement that gained momentum during this year Austrian activists sprayed the word “Schande” (shame) over the monument to call out for its removal or a proper contextualization. This was also a part of the election programs during the Viennese election 2020. All candidates gave statements on the issue and rated the topic on a scale on relevancy.
