    <span slot="text">While the figure of Dr Karl Lueger has already been critically discussed in the past few years a
      recent artistic intervention on the <br>monument has sparked new controversy around his memorial in the center of
      Vienna. Luegers raise to power was largely due to his use of anti-Semitic propaganda. His rhetoric and
      anti-Semitic views have inspired the young Adolf Hitler and shaped his later raise to power. So how can it be that
      the public is still splitting opinions on him?</span>
