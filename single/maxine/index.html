    <span slot="text">At first sight, the statue portraying a young girl seems harmless and peaceful. She’s sitting on a
      wooden chair, her fists clenched in her lap. Her expression is determined, her feet are bare, and on her shoulder
      sits a small bird. The statue is surrounded by flower bouquets and stuffed animals. Members of the community often
      affectionately dress her up in hats, scarves and blankets to keep her warm. How could this monument cause
      diplomatic incidents, threaten trade deals and strain international business relations?
      <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp; The Statue of Peace is a symbol of “comfort women”, a euphemism for
      the victims of sexual slavery at the hands of the Japanese military during WWII. In Korean referred to as 평화의 소녀상 (Pyeonghwaui Sonyeosang) which
      translates to "the peace statue of a girl" often shortened to 소녀상, (Sonyeosang) "statue of a girl." The first Statue of Peace was erected in 2011 in Seoul, South Korea, to call for remembrance and apology. Now there are over 100 monuments
      and counting worldwide. Not only does the Statue of Peace fulfil the function of commemorating the victims, but it
      has also drawn a lot of attention to the unresolved issues, pressuring the Japanese government to acknowledge its
      war crimes.

      <span slot="text">“Comfort women” refers to the system of sexual slavery created and controlled by the Imperial
        Japanese government between 1932 and 1945. It is the largest case of government-sponsored human trafficking and
        sexual slavery in modern history. Originally, brothels were established to provide Japanese soldiers with
        voluntary prostitutes in order to reduce the incidence of wartime rape, a cause of rising anti-Japanese
        sentiment across occupied territories. However, many women ended up being forced to work in the brothels against
        their own will. According to testimonies, young women were abducted from their homes in countries under Imperial
        Japanese rule.</span>
      <span slot="pull-quote">most scholars agree that hundreds of thousands of women were victimized, and that includes
        girls as young as twelve years old</span>
      <span slot="text"><br>Estimates vary as to how many women were involved, but most scholars agree that hundreds of
        thousands of women were victimized, and that includes girls as young as twelve years old. A majority of the
        women who were forced into sexual slavery came from Korea and China, although many women from Japan, Taiwan, the
        Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, East Timor, and the Dutch East Indies, as well as European
        women in Japanese-occupied territories, were forced into sexual slavery (Bisland, Kim & Shin, 2019).

    <div id="variable-text-slot">
      <span slot="text">Comfort women were usually injected with salvarsan (a highly toxic arsenic derivative) to
        prevent pregnancy, which together with damage to the vagina caused by the constant raping resulted in unusually
        high rates of sterility among comfort women. As the war went on and as the shortages caused by the sinking of
        almost the entire Japanese merchant marine by American submarines kicked in, medical care for the "comfort
        women" declined as dwindling medical supplies were reserved for the servicemen. As Japanese logistics broke down
        as the American submarines sank one Japanese ship after another, condoms had to be washed and reused, reducing
        their effectiveness (Duus, Peattie & Myers, 1996).</span>
      <span slot="pull-quote">those who did attempt to escape were publicly tortured and killed as examples to the
        others</span>
      <span slot="text">For the women, refusal to serve meant immediate punishment and torture. Each woman usually had
        to accommodate 70 soldiers (Takenaka & Cha, 2019). Many women were assaulted, tortured, killed, or committed
        suicide at the comfort station. In addition, those who did attempt to escape were publicly tortured and killed
        as examples to the others. According to testimony, when comfort women died, they were not properly buried and
        were instead abandoned in the street. The women were hungry and constantly abused (Bisland, Kim & Shin,
        2019).</span>

    <div id="variable-text-slot">
      <span slot="text">Comfort women on the frontlines had to share the fate of the Japanese soldiers. During frequent
        air raids, these women, along with the soldiers, had to be evacuated and hidden in mountains or caves. Lee
        described how, after the bombing ceased, the soldiers would set up makeshift tents and make the women serve
        them. Many women were killed by bombings or drowned in transit when transport ships sank. After the war, many
        other comfort women were murdered by retreating Japanese soldiers or abandoned. Some of the victims were rescued
        or captured as prisoners of war by the Allied Forces and eventually sent home (Bisland, Kim & Shin,
        2019).</span>
      <span slot="pull-quote">the subject of comfort women was ignored for decades after 1945 as victims were considered
        pariahs</span>
      <span slot="text"><br>Surviving comfort women suffered from serious psychological trauma and social stigma, in
        addition to long-lasting physical injuries. They could not talk about what happened to them because of the
        social stigma. Premarital sex is considered shameful in Confucian nations such as China and Korea, so the
        subject of comfort women was ignored for many decades after 1945 as the victims were considered pariahs. In
        Confucian cultures, traditionally an unmarried girl or woman must value her chastity above her own life, and any
        woman who loses her virginity before marriage for whatever reason is expected to commit suicide as to not bring
        shame upon herself and her family; by choosing to live, the survivors made themselves into outcasts (Thomas,
        2012).</span>

    <div id="variable-text-slot">
      <span slot="text">After the war, as part of an economic cooperation agreement in the treaty of 1965, South Korea
        received the equivalent of $800 million from Japan. Part of the agreement was a stipulation that once South
        Korea accepted the money, it would no longer discuss any of the events that had occurred during colonization by
        Japan between 1910 and 1945. By signing the agreement and taking the money, the treaty stated that all issues
        were settled "completely and finally.” The treaty banned official discussion of events that occurred during
        the colonization.
        <br><br>No evidence shows whether or not the leaders in either Japan or South Korea were aware of the comfort
        women
        issue at the time of signing the 1965 treaty. The treaty summarizes Japan's wrongdoings but doesn't specify each
        of them. It was not until 1991 that information began to spread widely when Kim Hak-sun decided to publicly
        share her experiences as a comfort woman under the Japanese government. Up until that moment, the Japanese
        government denied responsibility for the sexual slavery system. Kim Hak-sun sharing her story inspired many to
        do the same (Shiomi, 2019).</span>

        government approached the Japanese government after the statement for reparations, the Japanese referred back to
        the 1965 Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea, claiming that everything that
        happened during World War II had been completely and eternally solved. Using this treaty, Japan stated that it
        had already paid a lump sum to the Korean government and blamed the Korean government for not using the money to
        support the victims. Therefore, while they admitted guilt, they claimed that their previous reparations were
        enough compensation (Shiomi, 2019).</span>

      <span slot="text">Because the Korean government and its people were not satisfied with Japan’s response, the
        Japanese government decided to try to again resolve the conflict. The Japanese government established the
        <i>Asian
          Women’s Fund</i> in 1995, which collected donations from Japanese citizens to compensate comfort women victims
        in
        five countries. The fund was also used to present an official Japanese narrative about the issue. About $20,000
        was given along with $30,000 worth of medical and social welfare care to each of the 61 Korean and 13 Taiwanese
        victims, and $32,000 was given to each of the 211 Philippines victims. The total amount of the fund was 48
        million dollars, of which 42 million dollars was funded by the Japanese government. Each victim was also given
        an apology letter from Prime Minister Koizumi of Japan. However, there were many victims who refused to accept
        the compensation because the money was partially funded by ordinary people which made it unofficial and
        insincere. They felt that Japan wasn’t trying to solve the issue, but rather to save face.</span>
      <span slot="pull-quote">the new Prime Minister Abe has claimed that there never existed an official comfort women

        sued the Korean government together with comfort women victims, claiming that the Korean government was
        violating the Korean constitution by failing to protect the human rights of victims by not taking any action to
        solve the issue of the comfort women. In 2011, a new constitution was adopted which forced the Korean government
        to discuss the issue of comfort women with Japan. Because of the sexism and patriarchy deeply rooted in
        Confucianism, both South Korea and Japan did not prioritize relieving the sufferings of comfort women. And to
        make matters even worse, as Japan's prime minister had changed, the stance of the government had gone from
        apologetic to outright denial of the crimes. The new prime Minister Abe has claimed that there never
        existed an official comfort women system controlled by the government, but that the practice was solely the work
        of voluntary prostitutes (Mizoguchi & Dudden, 2007; Shiomi, 2019).</span>

        not be erected,” said Kim Eun-sung. “A sense of rage came over us. We took the plan further to make a
        sculpture.” The initial image the artists had in mind was of an old woman in her 80s - the current age of the

      <span slot="text">In December 2015 the Japanese and Korean governments came to a deal that was supposed to
        “finally and irreversibly” resolve the issue. Japan would pay ¥1 billion (US$8 million) to the victims. However,
        the deal fell short of the survivors’ demand that Japan pays formal reparations and accept legal responsibility
        for what they endured. And it proved to be one of the most unpopular decisions made by Korea’s President Park
        Geun-Hye because the government had failed to adequately communicate the proposed deal with the victims or to
        represent them properly. Moreover, they had not made crucial elements of the deal public, including demands from
        Japan that the term “sexual slavery” would not be used, because according to Japan, it “contradicts the facts.”
        Additionally, the deal demanded that South Korea was obligated to remove the Statue of Peace from outside of the
        Japanese embassy in Seoul (Kim & Park, 2015; Cho, 2019).</span>

      <span slot="text">In an act of protest, a second statue was erected in Busan, in front of the Japanese consulate.
        This angered the Japanese government, and they recalled two diplomats from South Korea and halted high-level
        talks. The Japanese government demanded that the statue be removed, saying that erecting it in front of the
        consulate-general violates the Vienna Convention on diplomacy, which calls for maintaining the dignity of
        foreign missions (Rich, 2017).</span>

        demand justice and proper reparations, while many Japanese feel their country has apologized enough. Surveys
        have found that the Japanese and Koreans have grown distrustful towards each other over the last few years and
        that the comfort women issue plays a big part in this (Ryall, 2019). After the statues in Busan and Seoul were
        erected, they started popping up all over South Korea to commemorate the victims and draw attention to the
        issue. There have been well over a hundred bronze Statues of Peace installed all over the country, and it did
        not take long before the Statue of Peace started travelling to other countries. Every time a new statue is
        erected, it sparks outrage among the Japanese. As the Statue of Peace travelled all over the world, it started
        garnering more international attention.

        monuments and statues, such as in the cities of Buena Park, California in 2013, and Fullerton, California in
        2015. Likewise, in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada, the statue could not be built and eventually moved to
        Toronto. Approximately 20 Japanese Canadians showed up at the monthly parks, recreation and culture commission
        meeting to protest the prospect of a statue commemorating comfort women. These cases illustrate the success of
        the Japanese government and right-wingers’ attempts to persuade local politicians and bureaucrats to stop the

        to erase things like the Nanjing Massacre and the comfort women from history books, to delete anything that is
        seen as negative from our history means that young people are ignorant about their own nation's past. And not
        knowing about Nanjing or other uncomfortable facts means that they are not able to make appropriate decisions on
        the future of our country” (Ryall, 2017). Former president Shinzo Abe, who resigned in 2020, has widely

    <span slot="text">The Japanese government has attempted to rewrite history by changing textbooks and presenting
      alternative narratives to the horrors that occurred in history. And as a result of the Japanese expressing
      outrage every time a new Statue of Peace is installed - filing lawsuits, sending officials in an act of protest,
      delaying high-level economic dialogue, pressuring other governments to have statues removed - ironically, the
      comfort women issue has garnered more attention than ever. And as long as they refuse to change their history
      books, apologise once again formally, and come to a proper agreement with the last few survivors, these Statues
      of Peace will most likely only continue to spread.</span>

          There are only a handful of comfort women left alive today, and soon they will all have
            passed. And even then, these statues will continue to tell their stories so that they may never be
            forgotten.
