    <span slot="text"> At first sight, the statue portraying a young girl seems harmless and peaceful. She’s sitting on
      a wooden chair, her fists clenched in her lap. Her expression is determined, her feet are bare, and on her
      shoulder sits a small bird. The statue is surrounded by flower bouquets and stuffed animals. Members of the
      community often affectionately dress her up in cloaks, hats, scarves and blankets to keep her warm. How could this
      particular statue cause diplomatic incidents, threaten trade deals and strain international business relations?
      The Statue of Peace is a symbol of “comfort women”, a euphemism for the victims of sexual slavery at the hands of
      the Japanese military during WWII. The one was first erected in Seoul, South Korea, in 2011 to call for
      remembrance and apology. Now there are over 100 monuments and counting worldwide. Not only does the Statue of
      Peace fullfil the function of commemorating the victims, but it has also drawn a lot of attention to the
      unresolved issues, pressuring the Japanese government to acknowledge its war crimes. </span>

      <span slot="text">“Comfort women” refers to the system of sexual slavery created and controlled by the Imperial
        Japanese government between 1932 and 1945. It is the largest case of government-sponsored human trafficking and
        sexual slavery in modern history. Originally, brothels were established to provide Japanese soldiers with
        voluntary prostitutes in order to reduce the incidence of wartime rape, a cause of rising anti-Japanese
        sentiment across occupied territories. However, many women ended up being forced to work in the brothels against
        their own will. According to testimonies, young women were abducted from their homes in countries under Imperial
        Japanese rule.</span>
      <span slot="pull-quote">most scholars agree that hundreds of thousands of women were victimized, and that includes
        girls as young as twelve years old</span>
      <span slot="text"><br>Estimates vary as to how many women were involved, but most scholars agree that hundreds of
        thousands of women were victimized, and that includes girls as young as twelve years old. A majority of the
        women who were forced into sexual slavery came from Korea and China, although many women from Japan, Taiwan, the
        Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, East Timor, and the Dutch East Indies, as well as European
        women in Japanese-occupied territories, were forced into sexual slavery.</span>

    <div id="variable-text-slot">
      <span slot="text">Comfort women were usually injected with salvarsan, a very toxic substance, to prevent
        pregnancy, which together with damage to the vagina caused by the constant raping resulted in unusually high
        rates of sterility among comfort women. As the war went on and as the shortages caused by the sinking of almost
        the entire Japanese merchant marine by American submarines kicked in, medical care for the "comfort women"
        declined as dwindling medical supplies were reserved for the servicemen. As Japanese logistics broke down as the
        American submarines sank one Japanese ship after another, condoms had to be washed and reused, reducing their
        effectiveness.</span>
      <span slot="pull-quote">those who did attempt to escape were publicly tortured and killed as examples to the
        others</span>
      <span slot="text">For the women, refusal to serve meant immediate punishment and torture. Each woman usually had
        to accomodate 70 soldiers. Many women were assaulted, tortured, killed, or committed suicide at the comfort
        station. In addition, those who did attempt to escape were publicly tortured and killed as examples to the
        others. According to testimony, when comfort women died, they were not properly buried and were instead
        abandoned in the street. The women were hungry and constantly abused.</span>

    <div id="variable-text-slot">
      <span slot="text">Comfort women on the frontlines had to share the fate of the Japanese soldiers. During frequent
        air raids, these women, along with the soldiers, had to be evacuated and hidden in mountains or caves. Lee
        described how, after the bombing ceased, the soldiers would set up makeshift tents and make the women serve
        them. Many women were killed by bombings or drowned in transit when transport ships sank. After the war, many
        other comfort women were murdered by retreating Japanese soldiers or abandoned. Some of the victims were rescued
        or captured as prisoners of war by the Allied Forces and eventually sent home.</span>
      <span slot="pull-quote">the subject of comfort women was ignored for decades after 1945 as victims were considered
        pariahs</span>
      <span slot="text"><br>Surviving comfort women suffered from serious psychological trauma and social stigma, in
        addition to long lastin physical injuries. They could not talk about what happened to them because of the social
        stigma. In Confucian nations like Korea and China, where premarital sex is considered shameful, the subject of
        comfort women was ignored for decades after 1945 as victims were considered pariahs. In Confucian cultures,
        traditionally an unmarried woman must value her chastity above her own life, and any women who loses her
        virginity before marriage for whatever reason is expected to commit suicide; by choosing to live, the survivors
        made themselves into outcasts.</span>

      <span slot="text">After the war, as part of a economic cooperation agreement in the treaty of 1965, South Korea
        received eight-hundred million U.S. dollars from Japan. Part of the agreement was a stipulation that once South
        Korea accepted the money, it was no longer going to discuss any of the events that occurred during colonization
        by Japan between 1910 and 1945. By signing the agreement and taking the money, the treaty stated that all issues
        “have been settled completely and finally.” The treaty banned the official discussion of events that occurred
        during the colonization.</span>
      <span slot="pull-quote"> the Japanese government had denied any responsibility for the sexual slavery

      <span slot="text">There is no evidence that shows whether or not the leaders in either Japan or South Korea knew
        about the comfort women issue at the time of signing the 1965 treaty. The treaty itself summarizes the
        wrongdoings that Japan did but did not specify each of them. It was not until in 1991 that its information began
        to spread widely throughout the public in South Korea, when Kim Hak-sun decided to publicly, without using a
        pseudonym, share her experiences as a comfort woman under the Japanese government. Up until that moment, the
        Japanese government had denied any responsibility for the sexual slavery system. Kim Hak-sun sharing her story

        government opened an investigation. Two years later after the Japanese government announced to investigate the
        credibility of comfort women issue, in 1993, Yōhei Kono, the Chief Cabinet Secretary, published the results of

        referred back to the 1965 Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea, claiming that
        everything that happened during World War II had been completely and eternally solved. Using this treaty, Japan
        stated that it had already paid a lump sum to the Korean government and blamed the Korean government for not
        using the money to support the victims. Therefore, while they admitted guilt, they claimed that their previous
        reparations were enough compensation.</span>

      <span slot="text">Because the Korean government and its people were not satisfied with Japan’s response, the
        Japanese government decided to try to again resolve the conflict. The Japanese government established the Asian
        Women’s Fund in 1995, which collected donations from Japanese citizens to compensate comfort women victims in
        five countries. The fund was also used to present an official Japanese narrative about the issue. About $20,000
        was given along with $30,000 worth of medical and social welfare care to each of the 61 Korean and 13 Taiwanese
        victims, and $32,000 was given to each of the 211 Philippines victims. The total amount of the fund was 48
        million dollars, of which 42 million dollars was funded by the Japanese government. Each victim was also given
        an apology letter from Prime Minister Koizumi of Japan. However, there were many victims who refused to accept
        the compensation because the money was partially funded by ordinary people which made it unofficial and
        insincere. They felt that Japan wasn’t trying to solve the issue, but rather to save face.</span>

      <span slot="text">The Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan (also Korean
        Council), a Korean non-governmental organization advocating the rights of the surviving comfort women, sued the
        Korean government together with comfort women victims, claiming that the Korean government was violating the
        Korean constitution by failing to protect the human rights of victims by not taking any action to solve the
        issue of the comfort women. In 2011, a new constitution was adopted which forced the Korean government to
        discuss the issue of comfort women with Japan. Because of the sexism and patriarchy deeply rooted in
        Confucianism, both South Korea and Japan did not prioritize relieving the sufferings of the comfort women. And
        to make matters even worse, with the change of prime minister stance of the Japanese government had gone from
        apologetic to outright denial of the crimes. The new prime Minister Abe has claimed that there never existed an

        embassy</span>
      <span slot="text">In an act of protest, a second statue was erected in Busan, in front of the Japanese consulate.
        This angered the Japanese government, and they recalled two diplomats from South Korea and halted high-level
        talks. The Japanese government demanded that the statue be removed, saying that erecting it in front of the
        consulate-general violates the Vienna Convention on diplomacy, which calls for maintaining the dignity of

      <span slot="text">outh Korea eventually terminated the 2015 agreement on November 21st 2018, and effectively shut
        down the Japanese-funded foundation which was set up to pay the agreed settlement. Koreans still demand justice
        and proper reparations, while many Japanese feel their country has apologized enough. Surveys have found that
        the Japanese and Koreans have grown distrustful towards each other over the last few years, and that the comfort
        women issue plays a big part in this.
        After the statues in Busan and Seoul were erected, they started popping up all over South Korea to commemorate
        the victims and draw attention to the issue. There have been well over a hundred bronze Statues of Peace
        installed all over the country, and it did not take lang before the Statue of Peace started travelling to other
        countries. Every time a new statue is erected, it sparks outrage among the Japanese. As the Statue of Peace
        travelled all over the world, it started garnering more international attention. </span>

        monument’s plaque are not appropriate for a public park where children visit. They felt the statue did not
        support world peace. The politicians hand-delivered a letter signed by more than 300 Japanese politicians to
        Glendale City Clerk Ardy Kassakhian that described their opposition to the statue. The group requested a meeting

        The Federal judge dismissed the lawsuit, because the Japanese-American plaintiffs did not sufficiently prove
        they had suffered from the placement of the statue. In April 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court declined a review of
        the case, ending the tense three-year debate over a suit filed by the residents.</span>

        Aichi Governor Hideaki Omura, who heads the organizing committee, told a press conference that there are growing

        museum,” which drew associations with a deadly arson attack on a Kyoto Animation Co. studio, according to Omura.

        multiple locations in North America, leading in turn to mass protest emails being sent from Japan to mayors,
        city council members, and others in influential positions. There have also been failed attempts at building
        monuments and statues, such as in the cities of Buena Park, California in 2013, and Fullerton, California in
        2015. Likewise, in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada, the statue could not be built and eventually moved to
        Toronto. Approximately 20 Japanese Canadians showed up at the monthly parks, recreation and culture commission
        meeting to protest the prospect of a statue commemorating comfort women. These cases illustrate the success of
        the Japanese government and right-wingers’ attempts to persuade local politicians and bureaucrats to stop the
        building of the memorials.</span>
      <span slot="h3">but why won’t the japanese government acknowledge these crimes?</span>
      <span slot="text">"A decade ago, the far right said it was going to 'reinterpret' Japanese history, essentially
        allowing them to put a positive spin on everything," said Makoto Watanabe, an associate professor of
        communications and media at Hokkaido Bunkyo University. "But now they are simply trying to erase things like the
        Nanjing Massacre and the comfort women from history books, to delete anything that is seen as negative from our
        history means that young people are ignorant about their own nation's past. And not knowing about Nanjing or
        other uncomfortable facts means that they are not able to make appropriate decisions on the future of our
        country." Former president Shinzo Abe, who resigned in 2020, has widely described as a right-wing Japanese
        nationalist and is claimed to have contributed to the rise of nationalism in Japan.</span>

        National Geographic with natives dancing around a fire. I watched the “comfort woman” statue in Seoul for three
        weeks. Not 24/7, but coming daily and often at night to watch the craziness ... When it rains, or is sunny,
        worshippers hold or prop an umbrella for their idol. When cold, students dress it up. Hold its hand. Brush its
        “hair.” Sing to the idol, dance for it. Bring it food and drink ... The beloved idol of comfort women
        cultists is their living goddess, far beyond what we would call a “memorial.” The cultists believe “she” has a

And as a result of the Japanese expressing outrage every time a new Statue of Piece is erected - filing lawsuits, sending officials in an act of protest, delaying high-level economic dialogue, pressuring other governments to have statues removed, ironically, the comfort women issue has garnered more attention than ever. And as long as they refuse to change their history books, apologise once again formally, and come to a proper agreement with the last few survivors, these Statues of Peace will most likely only continue to spread.</span>
