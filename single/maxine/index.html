    <span slot="text"> At first sight, the statue portraying a young girl seems harmless and peaceful. She’s sitting on
      a wooden chair, her fists clenched in her lap. Her expression is determined, her feet are bare, and on her
      shoulder sits a small bird. The statue is surrounded by flower bouquets and stuffed animals. Members of the
      community often affectionately dress her up in cloaks, hats, scarves and blankets to keep her warm. How could this
      particular statue cause diplomatic incidents, threaten trade deals and strain international business relations?
      The Statue of Peace is a symbol of “comfort women”, a euphemism for the victims of sexual slavery at the hands of
      the Japanese military during WWII. The one was first erected in Seoul, South Korea, in 2011 to call for
      remembrance and apology. Now there are over 100 monuments and counting worldwide. Not only does the Statue of
      Peace fullfil the function of commemorating the victims, but it has also drawn a lot of attention to the
      unresolved issues, pressuring the Japanese government to acknowledge its war crimes. </span>

      <span slot="text">“Comfort women” refers to the system of sexual slavery created and controlled by the Imperial Japanese government between 1932 and 1945. It is the largest case of government-sponsored human trafficking and sexual slavery in modern history. Originally, brothels were established to provide Japanese soldiers with voluntary prostitutes in order to reduce the incidence of wartime rape, a cause of rising anti-Japanese sentiment across occupied territories. However, many women ended up being forced to work in the brothels against their own will. According to testimonies, young women were abducted from their homes in countries under Imperial Japanese rule.</span>

      <span slot="text"><br>Estimates vary as to how many women were involved, but most scholars agree that hundreds of thousands of women were victimized, and that includes girls as young as twelve years old. A majority of the women who were forced into sexual slavery came from Korea and China, although many women from Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, East Timor, and the Dutch East Indies, as well as European women in Japanese-occupied territories, were forced into sexual slavery.</span>

      <div id="variable-text-slot">
        <span slot="text">Comfort women were usually injected with salvarsan, a very toxic substance, to prevent pregnancy, which together with damage to the vagina caused by the constant raping resulted in unusually high rates of sterility among comfort women. As the war went on and as the shortages caused by the sinking of almost the entire Japanese merchant marine by American submarines kicked in, medical care for the "comfort women" declined as dwindling medical supplies were reserved for the servicemen. As Japanese logistics broke down as the American submarines sank one Japanese ship after another, condoms had to be washed and reused, reducing their effectiveness.</span>
        <span slot="pull-quote">those who did attempt to escape were publicly tortured and killed as examples to the others</span>
        <span slot="text">For the women, refusal to serve meant immediate punishment and torture. Each woman usually had to accomodate 70 soldiers. Many women were assaulted, tortured, killed, or committed suicide at the comfort station. In addition, those who did attempt to escape were publicly tortured and killed as examples to the others. According to testimony, when comfort women died, they were not properly buried and were instead abandoned in the street. The women were hungry and constantly abused.</span>
