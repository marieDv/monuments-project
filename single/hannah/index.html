    <span slot="text"> Colonial traces can still be found in German cities. Unseen by many, colonial figures stand in countless public places, looking at us from their pedestals. One of them is Hermann von Wissmann, brutal commissioner and governor of former German-East-Africa. The Wissmann monuments represent german colonial policies, the exploitation of African countries, and the oppression of hundreds of thousands of Africans. <br></br> How can it, therefore, be that Wissmann is still honoured with a monument in the German city Bad Lauterberg, whereas a similar monument in Hamburg has already been toppled? What stories do these two monuments reveal about the past and present? And why is it essential to uncover these colonial traces? </span>

      <span slot="text"> Which role did Hermann von Wissmann play in German colonial history? <br> <br> 
            After the Berlin Africa Conference in 1885, Hermann von Wissmann (4 September 1853 – 15 June 1905) was given the task of putting down the resistance of the ‘colonised’ and solidifying the control in the colonies of German-East-Africa. From 1888 to 1891 he was Imperial Commissioner in German East Africa. He formed a 'Wissmann troop' of 1000 Askari (african soldiers), mostly from Mozambique and the Sudan. On so-called 'punitive expeditions' he practised the brutal 'scorched earth tactics': villages were looted, supplies set on fire and the captured people forced to work on the plantations of the German settlers. The victory over the anti-colonial resistance of the coastal population was transfigured by the colonial movement in Germany into 'slave liberation', and Wissmann became its protagonist. From 1895, Wissmann took over the governor's seat in German East Africa for only a few months. Health reasons led him to return to Europe, where he was shot dead by his own rifle on his estate in Styria, Austria.
            After his death in 1905, he was celebrated as a colonial identification figure and honoured with two monuments in Germany, one in Hamburg, the other in Bad Lauterberg. The one in Hamburg has been toppled in 1968 by students from the University, but the monument in Bad Lauterberg is still in the same place as it was more than 110 years ago. <br> <br>
            Why are there still so many colonial traces in German cities? <br> <br> 
            The colonial crimes committed by the Germans have long been glorified and barely contextualised. The memory of the colonial past in Germany was largely characterised by nostalgia and with a positive public memory. The student movement of the 1960s gradually began to critically examine the colonial past in Germany.

      <span id="1-img" slot="img" imgpath="./media/hamburg_monument.png" altimg="">9 — Wissmann monument, drawing</span>
      <div id="1-variable-text-slot">
      <span slot="text">The monument in Hamburg was created by Adolf Kürle, a German sculptor and painter (* 20 March 1865, in Kassel; † 6 April 1912, in Berlin). 
        The monument in Hamburg shows Hermann von Wissmann standing elevated on a pedestal, leaning on a settled sword, holding binoculars in his right hand, and looking into the distance. Wissmann is wearing an uniform and a helmet. An African soldier (Askari) is standing next to the pedestal, looking up to Wissmann, and holding a german flag in his hand. A dead lion lies under the german flag. 
        The monument shows the colonial racist exaggerated hierarchy between the African soldier and the colonial ruler. The lines of sight reinforce the impression of the master-servant relationship, as do the proportions: Wissmann's figure is 2.60 metres tall, the African soldier a mere 1.70 metres. The upward looking soldier and the dead lion symbolise Wissmann's supposed colonial power over humans and animals. The reclining imperial flag indicates a funeral rite: the flag is also spread over the coffin in military honours.
        On the front of the pedestal was a plaque with the dates of Wissmann's life “Hermann von Wissmann, born 4 September 1853, died 15 June 1905”, on the back was an inscription in German praising Wissmann's actions and attributes. On the left side was a text in Arabic and on the right a speech in Swahili inscribed in Latin letters: “Our lord of the past, he calmed the coast and pointed us in the right direction.”
        For the exhibition in the port of Hamburg, initiated by the artist Jokinen, a plaque with an inscription of the website ‘www.afrika-hamburg.de’ was attached to the new pedestal. People interested in the monument and the art installation could find more information on this website, as well as discuss about the monument and vote on what should be done with it in the future.

      <div id="2-variable-text-slot">
      <span slot="text">The monument in Bad Lauterberg was created by German sculptor Johannes Gottfried Götz (* 4 October 1865, in Fürth; † 11 September 1934, in Potsdam). <br> <br> 
        The monument in Bad Lauterberg shows Hermann von Wissmann standing elevated on a stone. His figure is disproportionately tall and measures more than 2 meters. He is shown in an uniform, wearing a helmet, holding a folded map in the one hand and a sword in the other one. The fact that the monument depicts Wissmann in disproportionate size and that he stands elevated on a stone that serves as a pedestal shows that Wissmann is attributed a special position of power. Through the objects, such as the map and the sword, which he holds in his hands, it can be interpreted that he is the one leading the groups and he can threaten others with violence. <br>
        At the front of the stone is the inscription “Wissmann”. At the base of the monument is a plaque with the inscription “Germany's great African Hermann von Wissmann, born 4 September 1853, died 15 June 1905. The grateful fatherland”. And engraved in the rock in Latin and in capital letters is the inscription “Inveniuam Viam Aut Faciam” (I find or I make my way.) <br>
        Behind the monument, a plaque was erected in 1971 by the 'Traditionsverband ehemaliger Schutz- und Überseetruppen' (Traditional Association of Former Protection and Overseas Troops) with the inscription: “He fought successfully against the slave trade and for the freedom of the oppressed”. The 'Traditional Association' glorifies and trivialises German colonial history and denies the crimes associated with it.
