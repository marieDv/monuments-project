      <span slot="text">Some monuments of today were created by accident, objects and structures that had a practical
        <br>function or were created unintentionally, which years later would hold a completely different meaning. Many
        of these monuments formed and shaped during times of conflict, when the rate of both creation and destruction
        are on a ‘monumental’ level.<br> Due to this rate we have been left with scars in our environment, some visible,
        and some just memories. There are many examples of this across the world, most prevalent in major cities where
        bombing raids occurred during times of war. These marks of history however are often ignored as monunents, and
        this is something that I would like to approach as a issue.<br>The monument(s) I will focus on are the
        structures known as the Flak Tower created during the Second World War to protect Axis cities from the allied
        bombing. Many have been destroyed apart from Vienna, were all structures still remian. These Huge monolithic
        structures dominate the Vienna skyline, and until very recently have been ignored and forgotten.</span>

      <span slot="text"><br> There are few visible remains of the SecondWorld War in Vienna today. With generous funding from
        the Marshall Plan, the badly damaged city was quickly re-built, virtually brick-by-brick. In many cases, the
        city’s wrecked theatres, churches and grand palaces were so well restored that not even close scrutiny by
        today’s visitor can distinguish between what is original and what has been recreated. <br> Also, there are few
        official war memorials. Indeed, only within the last twenty years have monuments been commissioned in the city
        to remind people directly of the terrible cost of Vienna’s wilful and inexorable slide into Fascism sixty years
        ago; these include the “Holocaust Memorial” (Holocaust Mahnmal) by British artist Rachel Whiteread, in
        Judenplatz; and the “Monument against War and Fascism” (Mahnmal gegen Krieg und Faschismus) by Austrian sculptor
        Alfred Hrdlickla, in Albertinaplatz. Yet there stands in Vienna a stark, immutable reminder of the years of the
        Third Reich: six huge reinforced concrete anti-aircraft towers whose blank facades and imposing mass contrast
        sharply with the city’s finely-restored historical architecture. --- Duncan J. D. Smith</span>

      <span slot="text">In 1942 Hitler had decreed that Vienna, like the capital Berlin and the busy port of Hamburg,
        should be protected by a series of anti-aircraft towers known as Flaktürme. (The word Flak is an acronym for
        Fliegerabwehrkanone, meaning anti-aircraft gun.) In Vienna three pairs of towers were constructed by German
        troops during 1943 and 2 in 1944 forming a defensive triangle centred on the city’s great cathedral, the
        Stephansdom (note 2). Each pair consisted of a large, heavily gunned attack tower (Gefechtsturm) and a smaller
        communications tower (Leitturm).<br> These monumental concrete fortresses were meant to serve as platforms for
        batteries of anti-aircraft guns. In order to boost the air defense of German cities, Hitler ordered the building
        of a series of immense towers throughout the country. Three of these towers were built in Berlin, additional two
        in Hamburg and, six more in Vienna.</span>

    <div id="2-variable-text-slot">
      <span slot="h3"></span>
      <span slot="text"> <br> The towers were not to be taken lightly, and were able to fire 8,000 rounds per minute with a
        range of up to 14 km in a full 360-degree field of fire. Each tower complex consisted of two separate towers,
        one of these 8,000 a minute G or gun towers and an L-tower (or command tower) which served as command center. In
        addition, the towers served as air raid shelters for up to 10, 000 people.<br> The tower walls were 3.5m of
        reinforced concrete, enough to survive an attack by conventional bombs carried by allied bombers of the age, but
        unlikely to survive the attack by so-called Grand Slam bombs especially designed for busting enemy bunkers.<br>
        Flakturm VII in Augarten, Vienna is a Generation 3 flak tower and was dangerous enough to be generally avoided
        by allied air-force during the war. Both G and L towers of Flakturm survived the war with little damage.</span>

      <span slot="h3">Locations </span>
      <span slot="text">The locations of the Flak Towers were incredibly important, in order to defend the City Center.
        As you can see form the image, all the 6 towers are located in groups of 2, in a triangle formation. This was
        done in order to have full coverage of the air above the City, this was effective! Vienna was one of the Axis
        Cities to recieve the least amount of Bombing from the allies, the bombers were terrified of the deadly
        Flak.<br> Towers were built in the spacious Augarten in the 2nd district of Leopoldstadt<br>(defacing in the
        process Austria’s oldest surviving Baroque garden dating to 1712). Another pair were squeezed into Arenbergpark
        in the predominantly residential 3rd district of Landstrasse. The third pair, straddling the busy thoroughfare of Mariahilferstrasse, were laid out in the 6th district of
        Mariahilf; one of these was built in the Esterházypark whilst the second was punched into the courtyard of
        the<br> Stiftskaserne barracks. </span>
