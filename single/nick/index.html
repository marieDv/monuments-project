Many of these monuments formed and shaped during times of conflict, when the rate of both creation and destruction are on a ‘monumental’ level. Due to this rate we have been left with scars in our environment, some visible, and some just memories.<br>There are many examples of this across the world, most prevalent in major cities where bombing raids occurred during times of war. These marks of history however are often ignored as monunents, and this is something that I would like to approach as a issue.</span>

These marks of history however are often ignored as monunents, and this is something that I would like to approach as a issue.<br>The monument(s) I will focus on are the structures known as the Flak Tower created during the Second World War to protect Axis cities from the  allied bombing. Many have been destroyed apart from Vienna, were all structures still remian. These Huge monolithic structures dominate the Vienna skyline, and until very recently have been ignored and forgotten.</span>
