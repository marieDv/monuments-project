        structures known as the Flak Tower created during the Second World War to protect Axis cities from the allied
        bombing. Many have been destroyed apart from Vienna, were all structures still remian. These Huge monolithic
        structures dominate the Vienna skyline, and until very recently have been ignored and forgotten.</span>

      <span slot="text"><br> There are few visible remains of the SecondWorld War in Vienna today. With generous funding
        from the Marshall Plan, the badly damaged city was quickly re-built, virtually brick-by-brick. In many cases, the
        city’s wrecked theatres, churches and grand palaces were so well restored that not even close scrutiny by
        today’s visitor can distinguish between what is original and what has been recreated. <br> Also, there are few
        official war memorials. Indeed, only within the last twenty years have monuments been commissioned in the city
        to remind people directly of the terrible cost of Vienna’s wilful and inexorable slide into Fascism sixty years
        ago; these include the “Holocaust Memorial” (Holocaust Mahnmal) by British artist Rachel Whiteread, in
        Judenplatz; and the “Monument against War and Fascism” (Mahnmal gegen Krieg und Faschismus) by Austrian sculptor
        Alfred Hrdlickla, in Albertinaplatz. Yet there stands in Vienna a stark, immutable reminder of the years of the
        Third Reich: six huge reinforced concrete anti-aircraft towers whose blank facades and imposing mass contrast
        sharply with the city’s finely-restored historical architecture. --- Duncan J. D. Smith</span>

      <span slot="h3">Castles of death</span>

      <span slot="text">In 1942 Hitler had decreed that Vienna, like the capital Berlin and the busy port of Hamburg,
        should be protected by a series of anti-aircraft towers known as Flaktürme. (The word Flak is an acronym for
        Fliegerabwehrkanone, meaning anti-aircraft gun.) In Vienna three pairs of towers were constructed by German
        troops during 1943 and 2 in 1944 forming a defensive triangle centred on the city’s great cathedral, the
        Stephansdom (note 2). Each pair consisted of a large, heavily gunned attack tower (Gefechtsturm) and a smaller
        communications tower (Leitturm).<br> These monumental concrete fortresses were meant to serve as platforms for
        batteries of anti-aircraft guns. In order to boost the air defense of German cities, Hitler ordered the building
        of a series of immense towers throughout the country. Three of these towers were built in Berlin, additional two
        in Hamburg and, six more in Vienna.</span>
    </div>
    <div id="2-variable-text-slot">
      <span slot="h3"></span>
      <span slot="text"> <br> The towers were not to be taken lightly, and were able to fire 8,000 rounds per minute
        with a
        range of up to 14 km in a full 360-degree field of fire. Each tower complex consisted of two separate towers,
        one of these 8,000 a minute G or gun towers and an L-tower (or command tower) which served as command center. In
        addition, the towers served as air raid shelters for up to 10, 000 people.<br> The tower walls were 3.5m of
        reinforced concrete, enough to survive an attack by conventional bombs carried by allied bombers of the age, but
        unlikely to survive the attack by so-called Grand Slam bombs especially designed for busting enemy bunkers.<br>
        Flakturm VII in Augarten, Vienna is a Generation 3 flak tower and was dangerous enough to be generally avoided
        by allied air-force during the war. Both G and L towers of Flakturm survived the war with little damage.</span>

      <span slot="text">The locations of the Flak Towers were incredibly important, in order to defend the City Center.
        As you can see form the image, all the 6 towers are located in groups of 2, in a triangle formation. This was
        done in order to have full coverage of the air above the City, this was effective! Vienna was one of the Axis
        Cities to recieve the least amount of Bombing from the allies, the bombers were terrified of the deadly
        Flak.<br> Towers were built in the spacious Augarten in the 2nd district of Leopoldstadt<br>(defacing in the
        process Austria’s oldest surviving Baroque garden dating to 1712). Another pair were squeezed into Arenbergpark
        in the predominantly residential 3rd district of Landstrasse. The third pair, straddling the busy thoroughfare
        of Mariahilferstrasse, were laid out in the 6th district of
        Mariahilf; one of these was built in the Esterházypark whilst the second was punched into the courtyard of
        the<br> Stiftskaserne barracks. </span>

      <span slot="h3">What about Now?</span>

      <span slot="text">After more than 70 years, the concrete towers are now an essential and integral part of the city
        of Vienna and its inhabitants. Today, the overall appearance of the Augarten park is defined by the tension
        between its tranquil idyll and acts of violence and destruction. A huge graffiti in the plinth area with the
        words ‘Never Again’ now greets visitors to the park.<br> Both towers in the Augarten park are owned by the
        Republic of Austria and administered by the Burghauptmannschaft. Although they have been leased by a data
        company (since 2002), to be renovated and used as huge data centres, they remain empty and closed to this day. A
        previous plan proposed the Gefechtsturm to be repurposed as a museum for contemporary history (between 1986 and
        1999).</span>
    </div>
    <div id="2-variable-text-slot">
      <span slot="h3"></span>
      <span slot="text"><br>The Augarten Gefechtsturm is a hexadecagon 43 meters in diameter. It is 55 meters high, has
        a basement and 13 storeys plus an added level for cannons. Most of the outer walls are 2.5 meters thick and the
        uppermost ceiling is between 3.5 meters and 4 meters thick. The flak tower consists of more than 45,000 cubic
        metres of reinforced concrete. Like every flak tower, this one also has an integrated natural climate system,
        which has remained almost intact. The entire technical infrastructure (electricity, water, gas, lift) has either
        been demolished or not been preserved. Following a grenade explosion caused by children playing in 1946 the
        Gefechtsturm is badly damaged both on the inside and the outside, particularly the upper storeys. As part of
        restructuring measures in 2007 two of the platforms known as Schwalbennester (swallow’s nests), which originally
        served as gun emplacements, were removed as they were at risk of collapsing.</span>

      <span slot="text">Despite their longevity, surprisingly little has been done to either adapt Vienna’s huge Flak
        towers to new uses or to acknowledge their status as memorials of war. Since 1945 the Austrian government has
        considered more than a dozen plans for comprehensive re-use of the towers but none has ever got beyond the
        drawing board. This has lead the structures to gradually fall into disrepair, victim to graffiti, vandalism and
        placement for satalittes. A structure with such historical relevance, left to decay and be forgotten.<br> Over
        time, as diverse new uses of the structure and surrounding park developed -from a playground and climbing wall,
        to an underground torture museum- a certain level of comfort with the tower’s presence is expressed. This also
        included proposals to wrap apartments around the outside of the towers, and to use the gloomy interiors as
        multi-storey parking lots, cinemas, and leisure centres.<br> Interview with Vienna local Rudolf H.
        ‘After the war, I can’t remember exactly what year it was, but they tried to blow up the towers. But that
        concrete is so thick it’s impossible. They would have to use so much force that the buildings all around would
        be affected.<br> That’s why it’s still standing there, like a monument. That was used to protect people, from
        the air raids. They had anti-aircraft guns on top, flak towers is what they called them, an air defence system.
        And whenever there was a bomb alarm people would run inside, for protection. That’s what it was built for!’

      <span slot="h3">Haus De Meers</span>
      <span slot="text">Due to their thick walls keep interior temperatures constant and the reinforced floors are able
        to support great loads, the towers make the ideal superstructures for zoological collections such as aquariums:
        that is, which require environmental controls and huge water tanks. With this in mind, the communication tower
        in Alpenverein has been successfully converted into the House of the Sea (Haus des Meeres) and 3 now houses many
        species including snakes, piranhas and crocodiles as well as sharks and giant turtles. <br> A door cut with much
        effort through the eight-foot thick reinforced concrete wall gives access to a conservatory (or biotope) known
        as the Tropenhaus, which is bolted on to one side of the tower; this addition contains a miniature rain forest
        complete with its own waterfall and fully grown trees. In addition, an elaborate climbing-wall has been
        installed on one of the exterior walls of the Alpenverein tower; a highly unusual urban reproduction of an
        alpine rock face. <br> An updated extension to the aquarium has now been confirmed for next year, visible on the
        right. A big and expensive upgrade to the building costing millions of euros. A artist historian group from
        Vienna made a petition for the upgrade to have some sort of historical reference, due to the fact that to do the
        upgrade involved removing a famous pice of Vienna artwork (Image to the right). (This artwork was a refernece to
        the war, and was on the face of the Tower for 50 years, to then just be replaced by a glass panel, hiding the
        true historical context of the building). The municipality responded by allowing the art group to put up a small
        plaque in the nearby park. </span>

      <span slot="h3">Modern Contextualisation</span>
      <span slot="text">On the initiative of the district administration Mariahilf, a plaque is being erected as part of
        the redesign of the Esterhazy Park, which contextualizes the flak tower in the Esterhazy Park. Between 1942 and
        1944 six flak towers were built in Vienna after plans by Friedrich Tamms, using a considerable number of forced
        laborers, especially prisoners of war, who suffered under inhumane working and living conditions. The completely
        preserved ensemble of Vienna’s six flak towers is one of the most significant relics of National Socialist
        architecture in Austria. There were never any serious plans to use the towers as memorials, nor were the towers
        distinctly marked as documents of the Nazi system. Numerous conversion measures were discussed and rejected
        throughout the decades.<br> The flak tower in Esterházy Park, which has been home to the Haus des Meeres (House
        of the Sea), a public aquarium, since 1958, is an exception. For a long time, the outer appearance of the tower
        was hardly changed by its use. However, as the space required increased, conversions interfered more strongly
        with the architectural design. In accordance with the City of Vienna, an extension realized from 2017 to 2019
        almost doubled the volume of the historical structure, making the original flak tower largely invisible. <br>In
        the course of this conversion, Lawrence Weiner’s conceptual artwork, the monumental inscription at the top of
        the flak tower “Zerschmettert in Stücke (im Frieden der Nacht) / Smashed to pieces (in the peace of the night),”
        was painted over in agreement with the artist. When the curators of Wiener Festwochen acquired the work as a
        temporary installation in 1991 and decided for the flak tower as its location, they deliberately placed the
        sentence in the context of Nazi history. The inscription became one of the most internationally renowned works
        of art in Vienna’s public space and existed much longer than planned. --
        https://www.koer.or.at/en/projects/memorial-plaque-esterhazypark/ <br> However this is only one small plaque at
        one Flak tower, you can see from this Vienna local that she feels this way about the Augartenpark Towers <br>
        Interview with Vienna local Johann S <br> I find it irritating that there’s no information here. No information
        panel about what it was. But whenever I walk past, it reminds me of a sad chapter. – The first idea that springs
        to mind is to landscape it. So at least the bunker disappears behind some greenery, give it an eco-purpose.

      <span slot="h3">‘Erase by Adaptive Reuse’</span>

      <span slot="text">Reflections on the uses of WW2 flak towers in context - wasteheritageresearch <br> Demolition is
        only one of the many ways by which the significance and material legacy of a specific place can be lost. The
        current paradigm of adaptive reuse argues that any use of a building is better than none, and that changes in
        use should be seen as positive creative adaptations that prolong the life of a building. This is reinforced by
        arguments about the environmental benefits of prolonging embedded material effects, and cultural benefits of
        collaged urban forms which like a palimpsest are writing over what was partly erased. In some cases however, the
        result of adapting a structure to a new use, even if it still achieves all these things, is either a deliberate
        erasure of negative memories or a calculated plan to aid in forgetting them.<br> All the flak towers are grouped
        in twos, with a Gefechtsturm (combat tower) and a Leitturm (lead tower) forming one pair. These pairs of towers
        are arranged in a triangle around the heart of Vienna’s historic centre, the Stephansdom. Originally, the Nazis
        planned to convert the flak towers into gigantic victory monuments to fallen German soldiers. After the war, the
        towers were to have been clad in white marble. Fortunately, history turned out differently.</span>
    </div>
    <div id="2-variable-text-slot">
      <span slot="h3"></span>
      <span slot="text"> <br><br> The tower’s concrete materiality, and debates around the demolition, preservation or
        adaptation
        of such structures both here and elsewhere, benefit from understanding that Weiner’s work is about materials as
        much as words. Concrete bunkers, air raid shelters and other massive elements often seem indestructible.
        Nevertheless there are examples of some that have been demolished, and certainly less massive concrete
        structures are now demolished all the time. Groups like Nonument! are now working to raise awareness and
        discussion about such less desirable legacies and the significance of their loss or destruction. <br> Strengths
        and weaknesses of a society are demonstrated in war, and these qualities are often mirrored in the memorials to
        its wars. Attempts to commemorate war unavoidably create a distinct political landscape. Whether a statue, a
        place, a building, or a combination of these and other elements, a war memorial is a social and physical
        arrangement of space and artifacts to keep alive the memories of persons who participated in a war sponsored by
        their country.' A memorial is an artifact that imposes meaning and order beyond the temporal and chaotic
        experiences of life. </span>

      <span slot="text">
        War memorials acquire their landscape definition from sentiment, utility, social purposes, and historical
        interpretations. Social purposes of identity and service can be used to express sacred and nonsacred sentiment
        for war memory, but honor and humanitarinism are used only to symbolize the sacred in memorials. When physical
        settings, forms of sentiment, and social purpose are combined in memorials, war memory socially becomes either a
        part of everyday life or a celebration of the past. Forms of meaning in war memorials are influenced by
        reinterpretations of political history that enhance, contradict, or deemphasize the status of past wars.’<br>
        There are plenty of war monumnets around the world to take example of, but in my opnion the one which I think
        Vienna can take inspiration from is the Atom bomb monument in Hiroshima.<br> The Hiroshima Peace Memorial
        (Genbaku Dome) was the only structure left standing in the area where the first atomic bomb exploded on 6 August
        1945. Through the efforts of many people, including those of the city of Hiroshima, it has been preserved in the
        same state as immediately after the bombing. Not only is it a stark and powerful symbol of the most destructive

        meaning of the surviving structure of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial is in what it symbolizes, rather than just
        its aesthetic and architectural values. This silent structure is the skeletal form of the surviving remains of
        the Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotional Hall (constructed in 1914). It symbolizes the tremendous
        destructive power, which humankind can invent on the one hand; on the other hand, it also reminds us of the hope
        for world permanent peace.
