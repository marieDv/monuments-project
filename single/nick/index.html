      <span slot="text">Some monuments of today were created by accident, objects and structures that had a practical
        <br>function or were created unintentionally, which years later would hold a completely different meaning. Many
        of these monuments formed and shaped during times of conflict, when the rate of both creation and destruction
        are on a ‘monumental’ level.<br> Due to this rate we have been left with scars in our environment, some visible,

        this is something that I would like to approach as a issue.<br>The monument(s) I will focus on are the
        structures known as the Flak Tower created during the Second World War to protect Axis cities from the allied
        bombing. Many have been destroyed apart from Vienna, were all structures still remian. These Huge monolithic
        structures dominate the Vienna skyline, and until very recently have been ignored and forgotten.</span>

      <span slot="text"><br> There are few visible remains of the SecondWorld War in Vienna today. With generous funding
        from
        the Marshall Plan, the badly damaged city was quickly re-built, virtually brick-by-brick. In many cases, the
        city’s wrecked theatres, churches and grand palaces were so well restored that not even close scrutiny by
        today’s visitor can distinguish between what is original and what has been recreated. <br> Also, there are few
        official war memorials. Indeed, only within the last twenty years have monuments been commissioned in the city
        to remind people directly of the terrible cost of Vienna’s wilful and inexorable slide into Fascism sixty years
        ago; these include the “Holocaust Memorial” (Holocaust Mahnmal) by British artist Rachel Whiteread, in
        Judenplatz; and the “Monument against War and Fascism” (Mahnmal gegen Krieg und Faschismus) by Austrian sculptor
        Alfred Hrdlickla, in Albertinaplatz. Yet there stands in Vienna a stark, immutable reminder of the years of the
        Third Reich: six huge reinforced concrete anti-aircraft towers whose blank facades and imposing mass contrast
        sharply with the city’s finely-restored historical architecture. --- Duncan J. D. Smith</span>

      <span slot="h3">Castles of death</span>

      <span slot="text">In 1942 Hitler had decreed that Vienna, like the capital Berlin and the busy port of Hamburg,
        should be protected by a series of anti-aircraft towers known as Flaktürme. (The word Flak is an acronym for
        Fliegerabwehrkanone, meaning anti-aircraft gun.) In Vienna three pairs of towers were constructed by German
        troops during 1943 and 2 in 1944 forming a defensive triangle centred on the city’s great cathedral, the
        Stephansdom (note 2). Each pair consisted of a large, heavily gunned attack tower (Gefechtsturm) and a smaller
        communications tower (Leitturm).<br> These monumental concrete fortresses were meant to serve as platforms for
        batteries of anti-aircraft guns. In order to boost the air defense of German cities, Hitler ordered the building
        of a series of immense towers throughout the country. Three of these towers were built in Berlin, additional two
        in Hamburg and, six more in Vienna.</span>
    </div>
    <div id="2-variable-text-slot">
      <span slot="h3"></span>
      <span slot="text"> <br> The towers were not to be taken lightly, and were able to fire 8,000 rounds per minute
        with a
        range of up to 14 km in a full 360-degree field of fire. Each tower complex consisted of two separate towers,
        one of these 8,000 a minute G or gun towers and an L-tower (or command tower) which served as command center. In
        addition, the towers served as air raid shelters for up to 10, 000 people.<br> The tower walls were 3.5m of
        reinforced concrete, enough to survive an attack by conventional bombs carried by allied bombers of the age, but
        unlikely to survive the attack by so-called Grand Slam bombs especially designed for busting enemy bunkers.<br>
        Flakturm VII in Augarten, Vienna is a Generation 3 flak tower and was dangerous enough to be generally avoided
        by allied air-force during the war. Both G and L towers of Flakturm survived the war with little damage.</span>

      <span slot="h3">Locations </span>
      <span slot="text">The locations of the Flak Towers were incredibly important, in order to defend the City Center.
        As you can see form the image, all the 6 towers are located in groups of 2, in a triangle formation. This was
        done in order to have full coverage of the air above the City, this was effective! Vienna was one of the Axis
        Cities to recieve the least amount of Bombing from the allies, the bombers were terrified of the deadly
        Flak.<br> Towers were built in the spacious Augarten in the 2nd district of Leopoldstadt<br>(defacing in the
        process Austria’s oldest surviving Baroque garden dating to 1712). Another pair were squeezed into Arenbergpark
        in the predominantly residential 3rd district of Landstrasse. The third pair, straddling the busy thoroughfare
        of Mariahilferstrasse, were laid out in the 6th district of
        Mariahilf; one of these was built in the Esterházypark whilst the second was punched into the courtyard of
        the<br> Stiftskaserne barracks. </span>

    <div id="1-variable-text-slot">
      <span slot="h3">What about Now?</span>

      <span slot="text">After more than 70 years, the concrete towers are now an essential and integral part of the city
        of Vienna and its inhabitants. Today, the overall appearance of the Augarten park is defined by the tension
        between its tranquil idyll and acts of violence and destruction. A huge graffiti in the plinth area with the
        words ‘Never Again’ now greets visitors to the park.<br> Both towers in the Augarten park are owned by the
        Republic of Austria and administered by the Burghauptmannschaft. Although they have been leased by a data
        company (since 2002), to be renovated and used as huge data centres, they remain empty and closed to this day. A
        previous plan proposed the Gefechtsturm to be repurposed as a museum for contemporary history (between 1986 and
        1999).</span>
    </div>
    <div id="2-variable-text-slot">
      <span slot="h3"></span>
      <span slot="text"><br>The Augarten Gefechtsturm is a hexadecagon 43 meters in diameter. It is 55 meters high, has
        a basement and 13 storeys plus an added level for cannons. Most of the outer walls are 2.5 meters thick and the
        uppermost ceiling is between 3.5 meters and 4 meters thick. The flak tower consists of more than 45,000 cubic
        metres of reinforced concrete. Like every flak tower, this one also has an integrated natural climate system,
        which has remained almost intact. The entire technical infrastructure (electricity, water, gas, lift) has either
        been demolished or not been preserved. Following a grenade explosion caused by children playing in 1946 the
        Gefechtsturm is badly damaged both on the inside and the outside, particularly the upper storeys. As part of
        restructuring measures in 2007 two of the platforms known as Schwalbennester (swallow’s nests), which originally
        served as gun emplacements, were removed as they were at risk of collapsing.</span>

      <span slot="h3">Vandalism, Decay and Neglect</span>
      <span slot="text">Despite their longevity, surprisingly little has been done to either adapt Vienna’s huge Flak
        towers to new uses or to acknowledge their status as memorials of war. Since 1945 the Austrian government has
        considered more than a dozen plans for comprehensive re-use of the towers but none has ever got beyond the
        drawing board. This has lead the structures to gradually fall into disrepair, victim to graffiti, vandalism and
        placement for satalittes. A structure with such historical relevance, left to decay and be forgotten.<br> Over
        time, as diverse new uses of the structure and surrounding park developed -from a playground and climbing wall,
        to an underground torture museum- a certain level of comfort with the tower’s presence is expressed. This also
        included proposals to wrap apartments around the outside of the towers, and to use the gloomy interiors as
        multi-storey parking lots, cinemas, and leisure centres.<br> Interview with Vienna local Rudolf H.
        ‘After the war, I can’t remember exactly what year it was, but they tried to blow up the towers. But that
        concrete is so thick it’s impossible. They would have to use so much force that the buildings all around would
        be affected.<br> That’s why it’s still standing there, like a monument. That was used to protect people, from
        the air raids. They had anti-aircraft guns on top, flak towers is what they called them, an air defence system.
        And whenever there was a bomb alarm people would run inside, for protection. That’s what it was built for!’

    <div id="variable-text-slot">
      <span slot="h3">What about Now?</span>
    <span slot="text">Due to their thick walls keep interior temperatures constant and the reinforced floors are able
      to support great loads, the towers make the ideal superstructures for zoological collections such as aquariums:
      that is, which require environmental controls and huge water tanks. With this in mind, the communication tower
      in Alpenverein has been successfully converted into the House of the Sea (Haus des Meeres) and 3 now houses many
      species including snakes, piranhas and crocodiles as well as sharks and giant turtles. <br> A door cut with much
      effort through the eight-foot thick reinforced concrete wall gives access to a conservatory (or biotope) known
      as the Tropenhaus, which is bolted on to one side of the tower; this addition contains a miniature rain forest
      complete with its own waterfall and fully grown trees. In addition, an elaborate climbing-wall has been
      installed on one of the exterior walls of the Alpenverein tower; a highly unusual urban reproduction of an
      alpine rock face. <br> An updated extension to the aquarium has now been confirmed for next year, visible on the
      right. A big and expensive upgrade to the building costing millions of euros. A artist historian group from
      Vienna made a petition for the upgrade to have some sort of historical reference, due to the fact that to do the
      upgrade involved removing a famous pice of Vienna artwork (Image to the right). (This artwork was a refernece to
      the war, and was on the face of the Tower for 50 years, to then just be replaced by a glass panel, hiding the
      true historical context of the building). The municipality responded by allowing the art group to put up a small
      plaque in the nearby park. </span>
