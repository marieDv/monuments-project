      <span slot="text">Some monuments of today were created by accident, objects and structures that had a practical
        <br>function or were created unintentionally, which years later would hold a completely different meaning. Many
        of these monuments formed and shaped during times of conflict, when the rate of both creation and destruction
        are on a ‘monumental’ level.<br> Due to this rate we have been left with scars in our environment, some visible,
        and some just memories. There are many examples of this across the world, most prevalent in major cities where
        bombing raids occurred during times of war. These marks of history however are often ignored as monunents, and
        this is something that I would like to approach as a issue.<br>The monument(s) I will focus on are the
        structures known as the Flak Tower created during the Second World War to protect Axis cities from the allied
        bombing. Many have been destroyed apart from Vienna, were all structures still remian. These Huge monolithic
        structures dominate the Vienna skyline, and until very recently have been ignored and forgotten.</span>

    <div id="2-variable-text-slot">
      <span slot="text">There are few visible remains of the SecondWorld War in Vienna today. With generous funding from
        the Marshall Plan, the badly damaged city was quickly re-built, virtually brick-by-brick. In many cases, the
        city’s wrecked theatres, churches and grand palaces were so well restored that not even close scrutiny by
        today’s visitor can distinguish between what is original and what has been recreated.<br> Also, there are few
        official war memorials. Indeed, only within the last twenty years have monuments been commissioned in the city
        to remind people directly of the terrible cost of Vienna’s wilful and inexorable slide into Fascism sixty years
        ago; these include the “Holocaust Memorial” (Holocaust Mahnmal) by British artist Rachel Whiteread, in
        Judenplatz; and the “Monument against War and Fascism” (Mahnmal gegen Krieg und Faschismus) by Austrian sculptor
        Alfred Hrdlickla, in Albertinaplatz. Yet there stands in Vienna a stark, immutable reminder of the years of the
        Third Reich: six huge reinforced concrete anti-aircraft towers whose blank facades and imposing mass contrast
        sharply with the city’s finely-restored historical architecture. --- Duncan J. D. Smith </span>
