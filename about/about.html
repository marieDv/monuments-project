    <span slot="text">By investigating the unique, localized stories of controversial monuments, the Information Design
      masters students at DAE hope to better understand the ideologies that allow for the creation and removal of
      monuments and how to navigate the space in between. We use our tools and perspective as information designers to
      illuminate these individual complex narratives and their connection to the continuing international debate.

      The debate is both hyper-local and global--with themes crossing borders and news stories reverberating
      internationally. However, the stories behind these monuments are often emotional and grounded in local values and
      experiences. Bridging this gap is a key challenge of understanding monuments.

      Below you can read more about how this project came to be.</span>

        the inspiration for the after monument
      </span>
      <span slot="text">
        In the fall of 2020 our tutors in the Information Design Masters program at Design Academy Eindhoven proposed a
        loosely collective project focused on the widespread protests in the summer of 2020, in particular the removal
        of figures memorialized for their roles in racist and colonial activities. Dozens of monuments were
        removed--mostly Confederate figures--in the United States, some by force, others by local governments. In
        Europe, the pulling down of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, UK by protesters and the removal of King
        Leopold II by Antwerp city officials made international news.

        However, from a distance the nuances within the debate, the story behind the emotions were often lost. Often it
        felt like there was a binary status–monuments in-place or a void where the monument stood.

        In a word, there was a lack of information regardless of what happened to the inanimate, yet deeply provocative
        statues.

      </span>
      <span slot="text">
        The public debates of whether removal is the right path of recourse and how to reckon with the colonial pasts and present in Europe and the countries they colonized is a rich and complex challenge. As information designers, we wanted to investigate further the practice of monument-making and history-telling in the public space. 

At the guidance of our tutors, Toon Koehorst and Jannetje in ‘t Veld of the design studio Koehorst in ’t Veld, we each set off in our own directions finding and researching monuments in our hometowns and elsewhere. That is the basis of this organic,   personal archive of 16 monuments.
