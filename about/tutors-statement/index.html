      <span slot="text">In June 2020 activists brought down the statue of Edward Colston, a 17th century slave trader
        from Bristol. The group took the bronze figure of his pedestal in broad daylight and dumped it in the river. The
        thing beaten, daubed with paint and dragged through the streets. A scene that looks somewhat like the toppling
        of Saddam Hoessein's statue decades earlier in the Iraq war. Activist Jen Reid climbed the empty pedestal and
        raised her fist. A clear salute to the Black Power movement.
        <br><br>
        The statue was only erected in 1895 and meant to honour Colston. In his life-time he used his ill-gained fortune
        for large works of charity in England. In the 1990's a campaign started to address the fact that Bristol was
        honouring a slave-trader in the centre of a city that has a large minority of descendants of victims of slavery.
        A new plaque was promised that would better reflect Colston's position. But it was held up. It took the outrage
        over the death of Georg Floyd and the Black Lives Matter protests to cut the process short.
        <br><br>
        The toppling of Colston does not stand on its own. Several campaigns like 'Bring down Rhodes' and a major push
        to remove statues of Confederate generals do get results recently. Statues are rallying points in a culture war
        between progressive and conservative political groups. Both see monuments as physical manifestations of culture
        and either want to change or defend it. Debates around monuments become very polarised very fast. Options to
        deal with them get reduced to remove or keep them. That most monuments mean different things to different people
        usually gets lost. Another element is that while they are political in nature, these objects are also
        expressions of their time. Times with specific material cultures and ideas about aesthetics.
        <br><br>
        All this makes it relevant to look at these things from the perspective of Information Design. In the department
        we tend to deal with questions around complexity. How can design as a method respond to phenomena that are
        difficult to understand. This can be because of extreme specialisation of a subject, or because of scales that
        are beyond comprehension.
        Here the complexity is embedded in history and politics. Two factors that can't escape each other and that
        continue to shape each other.
        <br><br>
        We started our course in September 2020, with Colston's demise as a fresh reference point. We discussed examples
        from The Netherlands, contrasting the Coen statue in Hoorn and the Hein statue in Delfshaven. Both of them
        erected in the 19th century in a flurry of nationalistic pride. To the people erecting them they were prime
        examples of Dutch initiative and source of national pride and wealth. Both statues were crowd-funded and had
        popular support. The statue of Coen, by todays standards a genocidal mass-murderer, has long been criticised and
        now has a plaque attached to it with a QR code. Hein, more a pirate than a colonial figurehead, has been moved
        around a bit and is largely ignored.
        <br><br>
        Erecting statues of great men is a very time-specific gesture itself. You could say in the west it coincides
        with a growing sense of individualism and humanism. In the 17th century you start to get other types of statues
        instead of only those of gods and their representatives on earth; saints and kings. People of great
        accomplishment get honoured with monuments. Statues serve as a reminder to their ideas and deeds. In the late
        19th century this idea gets hyper-charged as heroic statues materialise everywhere to fire up the idea of
        nationalism.
        <br><br>
        It is worth noting that it is specifically these statues that contemporary protesters are targeting. Especially
        the most colonial, revisionist or militaristic ones. It is striking that conservatives everywhere are rallying
        to exactly these grotesque statues to defend. Especially in the UK, the conservatives have made 'defending our
        statues' a key point in their recent campaigns. Instead of treating these examples as caricatures of their
        values, they actually re-elevate 19th century propaganda to the centre of contemporary debate.
        <br><br>
        This creates a sort of political mine-field in which to operate. A notion that both the students and us were
        very well aware of throughout the whole project. Students expressed great motivation to work on this topic but
        also felt apprehension whether it was their place to do so. Initiated by a call from the students we decided to
        invite two guest-tutors: Liza Swaving & Arna Mackic. With them we discussed the pitfalls in working on contested
        environments and topics. Liza Swaving is a curator and researcher and worked for Museum Volkenkunde and the
        Tropenmuseum. With her we discussed the ethics of dealing with heritage. Arna Mackic is architect, she has
        written about monuments and designs them. Her projects often relate to inclusion and exclusion mechanisms,
        refugees, collective identity and public domain. Arna was very helpful in showing us how to design in public
        space.
        <br><br>
        The course consisted of three parts. These are not assignments as such but starting points for design projects.
        A major part of any course in Information Design is for a student to form their own trajectory.
        <br><br>
        First everybody in the studio did an individual research into a specific monument. A biography of a monument so
        to say. The results of this research are on this website. They give insight into the context, meaning and debate
        around unique examples of public heritage. Most students took a monument from their own cultural background.
        This enabled them to tap into local sources for their research. This results in a rich range of researches about
        monuments that are hardly known in The Netherlands.
        <br><br>
        Next to this an exercise was undertaken in small groups. The aim was to create 'formulas' that could help
        understand any monument or statue in public space. The groups worked on different aspects that were recognised
        and named.<br>
        - The history group placed monuments on a timeline of political movements of the last two centuries. This shows
        how monuments relate to political systems. It gives a quick insight in how revolutions of thought trigger
        different types of monuments.<br>
        - The lifetime group came up with a diagram that sees a monument as a thing with a specific duration in time.
        Usually there is a debate leading up to the actual thing and after its demise there's a legacy of documentation.
        A paper trail of photographs and texts. This is very helpful to see statues not as a immutable objects that will
        always be there.<br>
        - The response group mapped ways of responding to a monument on a soft to hard spectrum. From petitioning, to
        paint to hacksaws. The overview highlights the lack of effect of 'permitted' behaviour opposed to illegal
        responses.<br>
        - The material group explored the material qualities of monuments.
        From the removal of concrete monuments being too hard and expensive to the exploits of copper thieves.
        - The map group explored geographical connections between monuments. As especially colonial monuments connect
        former colonisers and colonies.
        <br><br>
        Interestingly enough the third aspect of the project was never reallly taken up. We felt a logical conclusion to
        the research and development of tools would be an unsolicited proposal for a new monument. But this met with
        some apprehension by the group. They were wary to insert themselves into spaces where others might be more
        appropriate. An example that was referenced was Marc Quinn's unsolicited response to the toppling of Colston.
        Right after the toppling Quinn quickly appropriated the powerful image of Jen Reid with her raised fist and 3D
        printed it. Little over a month later he placed the life-sized sculpture on the plinth where Colston used to be.
        As he didn't have any permits it was removed the next day. Activists immediately challenged Quinn's entitlement.
        As he occupies a space that he also could have stayed out of to leave space for other makers.
        <br><br>
        But when pressed, most students also sincerely do not understand the need for erecting new physical monuments in
        this age. The act of monument building itself is seen as an inherently domineering act of appropriation of
        public space. In general the students see information design as a powerful tool to talk about and problematise
        issues. But it is in the media, more than in the street, where they feel this discussion should take place.
        <br><br>
        Looking back at the event that informed the start of the course, the downing of Colston, there is a striking
        parallel to this position. The whole thing feels very performative. With the crowd chanting, the statue torn
        down, just like on television. The statue dragged through the street and humiliated, just like on LiveLeak. And
        when Jen Reid climbs on the empty pedestal she poses for all the news photographers with a fist raised in the
        air.
        <br><br>
        It harks back to images of revolution, of historic reversals of power in society. The act of toppling a statue
        has also become a spectacle on its own. The fact it looks like Saddam and like the toppling of the Berlin Wall
        is part of the point. It looks exactly like a popular uprising. It wipes out the old and brings in the new. This
        is not to say that it is all an act, the statue has been removed. Just that the action and its recording is as
        important. Showing that it can be done is the point. This point is made not in physical public space but in the
        media. It functions as a reference to other possible topplings and to progressive change in general. Like
        erecting a marker in the public conscience. In that sense it also feels much more of a monument for our age than
        any lump of bronze ever could.</span>
